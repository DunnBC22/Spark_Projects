The head of the nozzle is rotatable, allowing for horizontal or vertical coverage. Essentially what the M-Pact nozzle does is pulsate the water stream and flicks it side to side (think of holding a regular hose nozzle and using your wrists to move it side to side).If you don't own a pressure washer or don't want to invest that kind of money, this is a good alternative to dislodge stuck on grime with minimal effort.As the packaging states, it is not for use on plants. I gave it a try on a weed that was growing in our garden. It will snap your plants and send dirty splattering due to the force of the impact. Overall it's an interesting tool to help get some dirt, grime or other substrates dislodged and removed, however the pulsating and unsteady stream makes it difficult to get a good clean. My recommendation would be to start off with the M-pact, then switch over to another nozzle that provides a steady steam of water to wash away what's left.</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Nails work great.

The damage is my fault. It can be prevented by draining or keeping from freezing. I'm going to buy several because I'm undependable at winter storage.

But it fails to deliver in the real world. Because of its latency in recording motion, you don't actually see anything until the event is over. For instance, A courier leaves a package on my front door step. Ten minutes later a thief walks up to the door, snags the package and immediately leaves the area. It takes about 5 seconds. The camera will not immediately begin recording for about 5 seconds. Once it begins to record, whatever it was that caused the motion sensor to trigger is long gone.

Only defect is the thumb grip over the hose connector is loose. It can turn without turning the hose connector, so I have to squeeze it.

Given that it is using only 1/3rd as much water as the old toilet on #2 and only 1/4 as much water for #1, I think it is great!  Let's be honest, the old toilet almost always left a little debris after #2 even after a 2nd flush.

The way you can really tell a good quality trigger clamp is after lots of heavy duty use, drops, spills, and scraping off lots of glue. Dewalt heavy duty clamps have been OK, Woodriver (Woodcraft brand) are OK, but they tend to pull or push the pieces of wood when tightened because the clamp heads don't come together perfectly square. These don't seem to have as much play so they come together fairly square. Because of this, I can tighten them on a glue-up and not have to realign the wood as much. They have pretty good strength. The triggers on Dewalt clamps sometimes come out or the plastic housing comes apart, but these haven't had any issues yet. One of them sometimes slips so I will see if they'll send a replacement. After using this pack for a while, I will buy another pack.</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Love the gold color, great for my outdoor furniture and very comfortable.</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Performed fine.

So I figured out how to load these into the flooring gun after some research. I used these on the rest of the house. Go in every time. I have had only one in over 5000 nails to not drive. These are holding all my flooring pretty well. Many people say the staples hold better but if they wont drive in then to me they aren't going to work. Very glad these are made.

It does not leak and it does have the option to lock the nozzle to allow a continuous flow so you do not have to grip the nozzle while using.

It is sturdy, the settings click into place easily and firmly, and I find the control arm much more advantageous than the screw type on standard nozzles. I usually drop it at some point and that creates a leak at the screw point but with this control arm that doesn't happen. I've experienced no leaks from either the point where the hose screws on, nor from between the setting wheel and the handle, unlike other nozzles I've purchased. Has all the settings I normally use and will ever need to use. Worked great for my car too, but I'm loving it most for when I hand water the grass since is sprays really far.

One thing you will need to do is be sure the hose is anchored. I found with the hose unanchored the water flow from the sprinkler twisted the position of the sprinkler thus changing the direction of the spray. Other than that it is a good sprinkler. I do like the fact also that it has a front port that can be used to mount the hose from the front or combine additional sprinklers.

I gave it a try on a weed that was growing in our garden. It will snap your plants and send dirty splattering due to the force of the impact. Overall it's an interesting tool to help get some dirt, grime or other substrates dislodged and removed, however the pulsating and unsteady stream makes it difficult to get a good clean.

The head of the nozzle is rotatable, allowing for horizontal or vertical coverage. Essentially what the M-Pact nozzle does is pulsate the water stream and flicks it side to side (think of holding a regular hose nozzle and using your wrists to move it side to side).If you don't own a pressure washer or don't want to invest that kind of money, this is a good alternative to dislodge stuck on grime with minimal effort.As the packaging states, it is not for use on plants. I gave it a try on a weed that was growing in our garden. It will snap your plants and send dirty splattering due to the force of the impact. Overall it's an interesting tool to help get some dirt, grime or other substrates dislodged and removed, however the pulsating and unsteady stream makes it difficult to get a good clean. My recommendation would be to start off with the M-pact, then switch over to another nozzle that provides a steady steam of water to wash away what's left.</td><td>List(ComponentsNot, Delivery & Customer SupportNot, Design & AestheticsNot, DimensionsNot, Features, Functionality, InstallationNot, MaterialNot, PriceNot, Quality, UsabilityNot, Polarity)</td></tr><tr><td>Nails work great.

It is fairly long - more than foot which is good for targeting water of plants like sticking into a plant pot in the back or getting to the base of a tree without bending over.See more</td><td>List(ComponentsNot, Delivery & Customer SupportNot, Design & AestheticsNot, DimensionsNot, FeaturesNot, FunctionalityNot, InstallationNot, MaterialNot, PriceNot, Quality, UsabilityNot, Polarity)</td></tr><tr><td>Made well & works great!</td><td>List(ComponentsNot, Delivery & Customer SupportNot, Design & AestheticsNot, DimensionsNot, FeaturesNot, Functionality, InstallationNot, MaterialNot, PriceNot, Quality, UsabilityNot, Polarity)</td></tr><tr><td>The installation was easy except two things:1.

Given that it is using only 1/3rd as much water as the old toilet on #2 and only 1/4 as much water for #1, I think it is great!  Let's be honest, the old toilet almost always left a little debris after #2 even after a 2nd flush.

The way you can really tell a good quality trigger clamp is after lots of heavy duty use, drops, spills, and scraping off lots of glue. Dewalt heavy duty clamps have been OK, Woodriver (Woodcraft brand) are OK, but they tend to pull or push the pieces of wood when tightened because the clamp heads don't come together perfectly square. These don't seem to have as much play so they come together fairly square. Because of this, I can tighten them on a glue-up and not have to realign the wood as much. They have pretty good strength. The triggers on Dewalt clamps sometimes come out or the plastic housing comes apart, but these haven't had any issues yet. One of them sometimes slips so I will see if they'll send a replacement.

This one started with adding a whole house water filter to our house. I have done some basic plumbing over the years but new to PEX, my cutter was a bit old so a new one was in order. The Kobalt PEX cutter was ideal and able to cut through the pipe in a single squeeze with a clean crisp cut. My older cutter did not have replaceable blade but this Kobalt cutter does so the blade can be replaced easily. I finished installing the water filter with no problems.
