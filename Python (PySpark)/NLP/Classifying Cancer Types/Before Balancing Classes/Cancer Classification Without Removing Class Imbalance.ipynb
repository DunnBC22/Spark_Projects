uncommon in children compared to adults The prevalence  of  palpable  thyroid  nodules  in  children  ranges  from    to    Sporadic  welldifferentiated thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy in children accounting for  of pediatric cancers  in  the  prepubertal  age  group  and  up  to   of cancers in adolescents aged � year2 The most common indication for thyroid surgery in children varies among published studies but thyroidectomy for malignant conditions is rising38 Data in children throughout the  world  are  relatively  scarce  The  objective  of  this study was to analyze the clinical data and outcome of thyroid  surgery  in  a  large  series  of  children  treated  at a  single  center  at  King  Faisal  Specialist  Hospital  and Research Center KFSHRC in RiyadhPATIENT AND METHODS With the approval of the Institutional Review Board IRB at KFSHRC the medical records of all patients  years old and younger who underwent a thyroid surgery between    and    were  retrospectively  reviewed We elected to include patients up to the year  to ensure a reasonable followup period Patients for the study were identified by a search of the operating room log for all procedures involving the thyroid gland for the specified age groupDemographic  data  clinical  features  and  surgical outcomes  were  collected  Specific  data  that  were  obtained included age at operation gender family history presenting  symptoms  history  of  radiation  exposure presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type  MEN   thyroid  function  test  presence  and  size  of  thyroid nodules by ultrasound presence of lymph nodes metastasis or distant metastasis fine needle aspiration FNA cytology  surgical  procedure  final  histopathology  and length of followup Outcomes analyzed were postoperative complications including transient or permanent hypocalcemia  transient  or  permanent  recurrent  laryngeal nerve paralysis wound infection and hematoma length of stay and radioactive iodine treatment and recurrences Thyroid procedures in this series included hemithyroidectomy  subtotal  total  and  completion  thyroidectomy Surgeries were performed by either an endocrine adult surgeon or a pediatric surgeon No intraoperative nerve monitoring was used Early in the series procedures were performed by adult endocrine surgeons but lately a combined approach was adopted where pediatric surgeons and adult endocrine surgeons collaborated in such cases  proceduresthe normal range in our laboratory regardless of symptoms Transient hypocalcemia was identified if it lasted for less than  months while permanent hypocalcemia was  considered  if  the  serum  calcium  level  remained below normal range and the patient continued on calcium  supplementation  after    months  of  the  surgery All patients with a family history of MEN  underwent genetic testing of the RET protooncogene to confirm the diagnosis All patients who underwent completion thyroidectomy  had  a  preoperative  and  postoperative vocal  cords  assessment  at  the  Otolaryngology  clinic Descriptive data were generated and comparisons were conducted using the t test for continuous data

medullary thyroid cancer  so  did  not  receive  RAI  In  the  remaining  five cases  there was no clear data whether those patients received RAI before or only after a recurrence All local recurrences  underwent  resection  except  for  one  patient who was lost follow up There was no mortality in this study DISCUSSIONThe most common indication for thyroidectomy in this series was thyroid nodule which correlates with previously published reports in the pediatric population35 Children with thyroid nodules have an estimated fourfold  higher  risk  of  developing  thyroid  cancer  compared to adults910 The high incidence of malignancy in this series suggests children with a thyroid nodule should be carefully evaluatedFNA is a valuablemethod for preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules However there are limitations on  the  routine  use  of  FNA  in  children  including  the need  for  sedation  sampling  errors  and  the  limited availability  of  experienced  cytopathologists11  Many previous studies reported high sensitivity and specificity of FNA in evaluating thyroid nodule in children1114 which correlate with our findingsOur data showed lymph node metastasis in  of  thyroid  cancer  cases  which  supports  the  notion that  children  with  thyroid  cancer  frequently  present with more extensive disease than adults Lymphnode involvement  at  diagnosis  is  seen  in    to    of children  compared  with    to    of  adults  with differentiated thyroid cancer1523 Because our hospital is the largest referral center in Saudi Arabia especially for oncology cases this may explain the large number of lymph node and distant metastasis In this cohortThe  most  common  complication  reported  after thyroidectomy in children is hypoparathyroidism with an incidence ranging between  to  which original PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0ccorresponds with our results of  which are reported as hypocalcemia in Table    One study found that total thyroidectomy central and bilateral neck dissection Graves� disease and malignancy were  risk  factors  for  hypocalcemia  after  thyroid  surgery3 In this cohort postoperative hypocalcemia was noted more in malignant cases but it failed to reach statistical significance Moreover there was no significant difference between benign and malignant cases in  terms  of  mean  age  gender  distribution  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or overall complications a finding that was reported previously26 Multiple studies in recent years have found an inverse relationship between surgeon volume and complication  rates2728  but  similar  data  in  the  pediatric population is lacking One study found that highvolume  endocrine  surgeons  have  better  outcomes  and shorter lengths of stay and lower costs after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy in children compared to pediatric surgeons general surgeons or otolaryngologists29  Scheumann  and  colleagues  also  concluded that a collaborative approach between pediatric and endocrine surgeons would have better outcomes This has led other authors to suggest that a combined approach with endocrine and pediatric surgeons in addition to pediatric endocrinologists may optimize the care of children with surgical thyroid disease given the low number of pediatric patients4 Our data do not allow for comparisons of different approaches given the late adoption of the combined approach The  recurrence  rate  for  thyroid  cancer  in  children after  thyroidectomy  has  varied  widely  in  reported studies  ranging  from    to    while  it  was   in  this  cohort  Only  a  few  studies  explored  the predictors  of  recurrence  Lymph  node  involvement multiple nodules male gender younger age histologic subtype and advanced tumor stage were risk factors associated with recurrence17233033 In  this  study    of  patients  with  malignant  lesions received RAI Although there are conflicting data regarding  the  indications  of  postoperative  RAI  treatment in lowrisk patients the current recommendation is that lowrisk patients can be treated without RAI3436There are some limitations to this study The retrospective nature may affect the validity and quality of the data The small number of cases in some categories did not enable us to compare groups and explore predictors relative to these factors On the other hand this study adds to the scarce data on thyroid surgery in pediatric age group Malignancy is the commonest indication  for  thyroid  surgery  in  children  and  FNA  is highly  diagnostic  Hypocalcemia  and  recurrent  laryngeal nerve injury are significant complications Cancerrelated  death  is  extremely  rare  but  recurrence  is  not uncommon and a significant number of patients with malignant cases received RAI treatmentoriginal PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0cREFERENCES  Trowbridge  FL

citation  subsets The first query QPub_plain is based on a plaintext search in PubMed titles and s using keywords The  second  query  QPub_indexed relies on the PubMed indexing scheme using MeSH terms and results are made exclusive of the previous set The third one QWoS_restricted is based on a plaintext search in WoS restricted to the two research areas �Medical Informatics� and �Health Care Sciences  Services� The fourth query QWoS_filtered is based on the same plaintext search used in WoS but filtered by nonrelevant research areas eg Archeology Dance Zoology etc and the two research areas of the previous query It is of note that the two WoS queries select  only  nonPubMedindexed  papers that are supposed to be caught by the two PubMed queriesA  first  review  of  the  four  subsets  of retrieved  citations  was  performed  by  the two section editors to select  candidate best papers Following the IMIA Yearbook protocol these candidate best papers were then individually reviewed and rated by both section editors the chief editor of the Decision Support section and external reviewers from the international Medical Informatics community Based on the reviewers� ratings and comments the Yearbook editorial committee then selected the best papers of the year in the decision support domainIMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics                                    IMIA and

individual screening independently performed by both section editors based on the title and  of papers  not rejected by both section editors were discussed by the two editors to achieve a final selection of  candidate best  papers After  the  external  review  of these    s  the  editorial  committee finally selected three of them as best papers for  [�] Table  They are discussed in the next section and summaries of their contents are available in the AppendixDiscussion and OutlookIn the first paper Hendriks  [] propose an approach to the modeling of clinical practice guidelines which certainly builds on already existing approaches but which is systematically conducted in order to be scalable and used to represent complex guidelines They promote the formalism of clinical decision trees CDTs as they are both clinically interpretable  by  healthcare  professionals and  computerinterpretable  thus  suitable for implementation in datadriven CDSSs The disambiguation of textual guidelines is supported first by the formal unequivocal specification of data items used as decision criteria using international coding systems to enforce interoperability and second by the representation of guideline knowledge as CDTs The method is applied to the Dutch breast cancer guidelines Sixty CDTs were built  involving  a  total  of    data  items among  which    could  not  be  linked  to standard terminologies The authors report the ambiguity of certain criteria which could be subjective or had multiple definitions The resulting knowledge base was implemented in a decision support application where it can be interactively browsed or automatically executed By modeling guidelines in such a way this work is a step forward in the sharing of encoded knowledgeIn the second paper Kamišalić  [] tackled the issues linked to the formalization of the medical processes used for managing chronic diseases and their execution in CDSSs They analyzed the decisionmaking dimensions of the therapeutic management of chronic diseases like those known to increase the cardiovascular risk and identified three basic levels therapy strategy dosage adaptation and intolerance management To handle these  different  aspects  consistently  they propose a formalism called extended Timed Transition Diagram eTTD With eTTDs they illustrate the multilevel and finegrained modeling required to capture the contents of arterial hypertension management guidelines This detailed demonstration on how procedural knowledge for hypertension management can be formalized to develop a CDSS could certainly be used in other medical domainsThe third paper by Khalifa  [] presents a conceptual and practical framework to help assess confidence in predictive tools GRASP  for  Grade  and Assess  Predictive Tools is both a method to look for evidence from the published literature and an analysis grid It standardizes the assessment of the available literature associated to a predictive tool and the grading of its level of proof Three phases of evaluation are considered i before the implementation of the tool to assess both its internal and external validity ii during the implementation to assess its potential effect and usability and iii after the implementation to assess its effectiveness and safety In each phase the level of evidence  can  be  assessed  from  the  study design A qualitative  summarizes the direction of evidence positive negative mixed This grid can be considered as similar to existing grids for instance the CONSORT statement for clinical trials However it gives a rigorous methodology for a critical appraisal of predictive tools and could be extended to all kind of CDSSs It might be a useful tool to extend the evidencebased culture in the field of medical informaticsBesides the three best papers selected for the  Decision  Support section  of  the   edition of the IMIA Yearbook several other works retrieved from the literature review deserve to be cited Some of them deal with the personalization of decisions Laleci   []  propose  a  scientific  and  technical approach to develop personalized care plans that comply with clinical practice guidelines for the management of complex polypathology situations Jafarpour  [] propose a solution to dynamically manage the conflicts that can rise in this type of complex contexts Ben Souissi  [] introduce the use of health  information  technology  involving multiple criteria decision to support the choice between antibiotics alternatives Interestingly other works promote the creation and sharing of operational knowledge bases as exemplified by Hendriks  [] Thus Huibers  [] transform the textual STOPPSTART criteria into unambiguous definitions mapped to  medical  terminologies  Canovas et  al [] formalize EUCAST expert rules as an ontology and production rules to detect antimicrobial therapies at risk of failure M�ller  [] propose an   diagnostic knowledge base that can compete with commercial ones Replacing humans is another topic of research and Spnig  [] work on two aspects to virtualize a doctor the automatic acquisition of data through sensors and speech recognition and the automation of diagnostic reasoning Rozenblum et al[] propose a machine learning method to generate clinically valid alerts to detect errors in prescriptions Acceptability  of  CDSS  is  another  key point Kannan  [] propose a method for a CDSS design to best meet a precisely specified and assessable user purpose Design alerts  may  also  avoid  rejection  of  CDSSs by caregivers Fernandes  [] created algorithms able to aggregate filter and reduce the notifications delivered to healthcare professionals Amrose et  al [] tried to understand in real life the impact of alerts on users and to find the actions they triggered Finally it is always interesting to obtain varied evaluation results of controversial CDSSs In this respect Kim  [] evaluated Watson for Oncology in thyroid carcinoma and reported a concordance rate with local practices considered as too low to adopt the tool As  evidenced  by  the  number  and  the variety of works around decision support research in the field is

narrative and described in large textual documents the aim of this work was to model complex guidelines as datadriven clinical decision trees CDTs that could be still humaninterpretable while computerinterpretable for implementation in decision support systems The Dutch national breast cancer guidelines were translated into CDTs Data items  which  characterize  the  patient  and the tumor

endothelium is crucial for vein integrity andprevention of thrombosis9 and its focal disruption maypredispose to vessel thrombosis2 SV manipulation andimplantation leads to loss of endothelial integrity and elicitsan inﬂammatory response with platelet adhesion and leukocyte recruitment Notwithstanding an overt thrombosis isextremely rare in the operating room SV dissection results inblood ﬂow disruption in vasa vasorum and causes adventitial damage hypoxia and vessel wall hyponutrition10 Acuteperioperative saphenous vein graft failure is almost always aresult of graft thrombosis but this very uncommonly occursprior to graft placement Surgical factorslike technicalanastomotic failure or severe disproportion between thetarget vessel and the graft may lead to thrombosis butvessel

hypothesized that increased thrombin generation and prothrombotic ﬁbrin clot phenotype were responsiblefor the clinical presentation Conversion of ﬁbrinogen to ﬁbrinfacilitated by thrombin is a concluding step of coagulation Ithas been shown that ﬁbrin clots with small pores betweentightly packed thin ﬁbrin ﬁbers are relatively lysis resistant12Such clot phenotype has been evidenced in multiple thromboticpathologies such as myocardial infarction6 ischemic stroke13and venous thromboembolism4 The prothrombotic clotphenotype reﬂected by a tendency to form dense ﬁbrin clotsresistant to lysis has been previously reported in patients withinstent thrombosis14 While routine thrombophilia screeningresults in a high almost  detection rate of commonhypercoagulable states15 there are prothrombotic conditionsthat escape routine diagnostic approach The overall microscopic clot appearance and prothrombotic ﬁbrin properties lead tothe discovery of two mutations in our patient that are notroutinely tested during thrombophilia screening namely ﬁbrinogen 455G  A and FXIII100G  TElevated ﬁbrinogen was postulated as one of the riskfactors for early graft failure after CABG1116

FXIIIVal34Leu polymorphism was shown to be associated withrisk myocardial infarction21 FXIII is crucial to thrombusstabilization and changes of its plasma concentration reﬂectnonspeciﬁcally the extent of thrombosis as shown by Li et alin a study on patients with cerebral venous thrombosis22Interesting associations of FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism andthrombotic disorders have been reported Jung et al reportedin a metaanalysis of  studies that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss23Although no association with the incidence of ischemicstroke was found for this polymorphism24 apparentlywhen the stroke occurs Val34Leu polymorphism of FXIIIaffects the severity of its outcome25 Furthermore Kreutzand colleagues suggested in  that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism may increase risk of recurrent MI and death inpatients with angiographically established coronary arterydisease26 In  our group has shown in a study of patients that in patients undergoing CABG FXIII Leu34 alleleis associated with decreased ﬁbrin clot permeability andefﬁciency of ﬁbrinolysis27ConclusionOur extensive workup showed that ﬁbrinogen HaeIII andFXIII Val34Leu polymorphisms are reﬂected in reduced clotpermeability and susceptibility to lysis These mutationslikely contributed to intraoperative saphenous graft thrombosis Further studies are needed to elucidate the role ofthese

protecting the basement membrane of normaltissues andinhibiting the growth and metastasis oftumorresults alsoshowed that age microcalciﬁcation irregular shape and lesion diameter and numbercells Thecurrentwere risk factors for PTC Logistic regression analysis showed that age  14 yearswas an important risk factor for PTC inline with the ﬁndings of Yu et al21Microcalciﬁcation is caused by the deposition of calcium salts at the tip of the nippleor the secretion of calcium salts by thetumor itself and has been considered tobe the most speciﬁc sign of PTC In thisstudy the incidence of microcalciﬁcationwas higher in PTC patients compared withthe control group and logistic regressionidentiﬁed it as an independent risk sign forthyroid PTC Our results also identiﬁedirregular morphology two nodules and anodule diameter  14 cm as danger signs forPTClargely consistent with previousﬁndings22This study had some limitations It was asinglecenter study with a relatively smallnumber of cases Moreover the relevantthyroid hormone analysis and other serumindicators could not be followed up for alonger periodtreating PTC FurthermoreIn summary the results of this studyshowed that RFA could shrink or eliminatethyroid lesions thus representing a minimally invasive safe and effective methodforserumlevels of MMP2 and MMP9 before RFAcould provide a valuable reference for thediagnosis of PTC These serological indexes combined with relevant risk factors mayalso help to predict the prognosis of PTCafter ablationAcknowledgementsThis work wasProvincial HealthCommission  Project

and accurate2526 RFA is considered an effectiveand safe treatment for control of BTNsIn most cases the incidence of haemorrhage and other complications is low20However haemorrhage is sometimes lifethreatening because serious haematomasmay compress the upper airways Manyreports have described active bleedingduring FNA of thyroid nodules and RFAof hepatocellular carcinomas14�� andsome reports have described fatalities14ThusimportantcomplicationhaemorrhageanisThree types of haemorrhage may occurperithyroidal subcapsular and intranodular121427� The mechanism of haemorrhage is thoughtto be related to themechanical or thermal injuries induced bythe RFA electrode tip3031 Thyroid nodulesreportedly have abundant capsular vesselsthat are usually anastomosed with vesselspenetrating into the core32 These numerousvessels are abnormal thinwalled and susceptible to rupture Large thyroid nodulesare another cause of haemorrhage becausemultiple insertions are often required totreat such nodules In additionthepatient cannot coordinate with the physician during the RFA procedure the perithyroidal orintrathyroidal vessels mayeasily be damaged by movement of theneedle tip or production of heat

are both essential Patient cooperationis the ﬁrst requirement When the needle tipis in the patient�s body any uncooperativemotion of the patient may lead to injury ofvessels or other structures Most patientscan endure the procedure under local anaesthesia however anxious patients mayrequire general anaesthesia to achieve cooperation If possible smallbore electrodesshould be chosen to decrease the risk ofbleeding35 It is necessary to cauterise thesupplying vasculature of nodules to avoidrecurrence and residue Howeverthepuncture route should be carefully designedto avoid pericapsular vessels and the electrode tip should be closely monitoredActive bleeding during needle puncture isvisible as a rapidly expanding hypoechoicor anechoic signal Locating the haemorrhagic focus is not difﬁcult with CEUSguidance The bleeding pointcan beblocked by RF electrode tip insertion anddirect ablation When the bleeding is toorapid to control with the RF electrode tipby increasing the power drug injection is asuitable alternative Lyophilised thrombin 0cHu et alpowder can be dissolved in normal salineand then injected at the bleeding pointthrough a syringe with US guidance Onereport also described haemorrhage treatedby local injection of hypertonic saline andepinephrine solution in a patient with hepatocarcinoma36 Mildbleeding whichappears as a hypoechoic layer can mostlybe controlled using ice and compression ofthe neck for several minutes after the procedure30 All bleeding can be controlled byconservative methodsthus no surgicalintervention is needed Ecchymosis can befound after the procedure and usually disappears in approximately  to  weeksPostprocedure CEUS is indispensablefor all patients regardless of whether bleeding occurs CEUS is an objective evaluationtool for active bleeding37 Close clinicalobservation for  hours postoperatively isrecommended in our department becausemost bleeding occurs during the ﬁrstlobectomy38Observation of the neck can help to detecta haematoma early and may aid in preventing serious adverse effectsthyroidhoursafterConclusionAcute thyroid bleeding is one possible complication of RFA although rare it is potentially lifethreatening Proper selection ofpatients and sufﬁcient preparation areessential During the RFA procedureboth an effective clinical strategy and adequate technical skills are indispensable Thephysician should trace the electrode tipusing realtime US and sufﬁciently managebleeding Mild bleeding has limited morbidity and can be easily controlled by compression Active bleeding tends to be rarehowever it may be disastrous if the operator is unaware or careless Direct ablationwith the RF electrode tip and drug injectioninto the bleeding focus are effective modalities for active bleeding CEUS and closeobservation are also recommended afterthe procedureto detect abnormalitiesearly RFA is an effective and relativelysafe alternative for selected patients withBTNs if performed by skilled

with osteoporoticFNFs AOOTA 31BC The data demonstrated that patients treated with CTAshowed better improvements in functionaloutcomes and key orthopaedic complications than those treated with UTAThe

interesting toexplore whether the prosthesis materialinﬂuencesthepeak effect and the duration of the effectand if so what mechanisms affect the bonemicrostructure and whether there is a wayto change the outcome by blocking thiseffect during a 2year followup We currently have one option for prevention oravoidance of adverse events and thesechanges in treatment strategies may play akey role in improving the clinical resultsif the effects of the prosthesis materialitself cannot be blocked18 There is still alack of consensus on standards for prosthesis revision in this context19When assessing the impact of CTA onthe target events we did not observe anincreased incidence of severe orthopaediccomplications other than the complicationsmentioned in this study In one systematicreview the authors presumed that CTA wassuperior to UTA with respect to functionalscores and tolerable orthopaedic complications20 We obtained analogous results interms of hiprelated complications andfunctional scores Multicentre hip arthroplasty data indicate that UTA remains ahighrisk factor for late revision looseningand periprosthetic fractures810 The notabledissimilarities in the results of these variousstudies on hiprelated complications may belargely attributed to the design of the prosthesis prosthesis size and material selection and the surgeon�s experience46affected theThis study has several limitations It hada small sample and its retrospective designis association with some inherent disadvantages We did not stratify the patientsaccording to fracture type or sex In addition the potential comorbidities betweengroups were not well exposed and compared The statistical power used to addressdifferences between the groups was insufﬁcient Differences in the patients� baselinedata may haveresultsFurthermore our analysis did not determine whether the deaths were instigatedby bone cement The risk of hiprelatedcomplications was not analysed The survivalcurve of other prosthesisrelatedcomplications was estimated using theKaplan�Meier method and competitiverisks ie death could have affected thesurvival of the prosthesis Patients whodied lostrevisionHence the revision rate might have beenunderestimated during this long followupwith a fairly high mortality ratethe opportunity forevidenceIn conclusion the ﬁndings described inthe current review uphold an increasingbody ofthat CTA provideshigher functional scores and lower rates ofhiprelated complications than does UTAin elderly patients with osteoporotic displaced FNFs AOOTA 31BC In thiscontext we recommend CTA for the treatment of such FNFs Our ﬁndings may beconducive to alleviating continuing debateregarding which prosthesis UTA or CTAis more suitable for the elderly populationA future

 Treatmentmore work is needed to elucidate the underlying moleculardrivers and resistance mechanisms in GCGastric cancer is classified mainly using either the Laurenclassification or the World Health anization WHO criteria The Lauren classification compares tumors based ongrowth invasion pattern with  subtypes intestinal well differentiated diffuse poorly differentiated and intermediatemixed67 The majority of patients outside US with GC areyounger 60years old and have the poorly differentiated diffuse subtype which is located within the distal portion of thestomach characterized by poor cellular differentiation and highintratumor heterogeneity This subtype has poorer outcomesdue to its widespread infiltration and invasive nature of thedisease78 Conversely within the United States the pathologyof GC is similar to that of malignancies found within the gastroesophageal junction8 Older patients are primarily impactedand the disease is commonly well differentiated intestinalThe welldifferentiated subtype is found in the cardia or lowerregion of the stomach with welldefined glandular structuresand growth pattern The WHO designation for GC was createdin  and expands vastly on the Lauren classification67There are  subtypes tubular adenocarcinoma papillary adenocarcinoma mucinous adenocarcinoma poorly cohesiveSignet ring cell carcinoma and mixed carcinoma67 Similarities exist between the Lauren and WHO classificationsSignetring cell carcinoma comparable to poorly differentiatedGC is steadily increasing in incidence within the United Statesand around the world9 This increase is attributed to  eradication efforts of Helicobacter pylori a pathogen known toinduce intestinal type GC  increases in genetic predisposition to genes such as Ecadherin CDH1

markersincluding SOX17 hypermethylation BCL2 transforminggrowth factor beta TGFb vascular endothelial growth factorVEGFR and HER21418 Many of these proposed markersare studied extensively and do not serve as ideal targets dueto their limited clinical utility as either drug targets or predictors of therapeutic response Some examples of this include lesssuccessful attempts to target HER2 with monoclonal antibodiesand the use of TGFb inhibitors which although promisinghave proven to be highly toxic1920 Additionally these targetshave demonstrated limited clinical utility due to the crosstalkbetween TGFb and other signaling pathways such as RAS aknown nontargetable protein2122 While VEGF inhibitors areused as a therapeutic modality in GC they do not improveoverall survival23 An indepth investigation of the molecularmechanisms are urgently and investigations need to be distinctfrom the commonly studied and clinically intractable targetsAlthough this is the case discrepancies exist within the literature as some groups look at the molecular composition of GC asa whole while others focus on differences within the Laurenclassification systemUsing the Oncomine database we have found significantupregulation in several understudied genes in all GCs including COL3A1 COL5A2 SPON2 and CDH11 Table  Wealso have confirmed the upregulated status of many of thegenes found within the literature that are somewhat well knownsuch as INHBA a gene associated with poor overall outcomes24 but are still understudied Claudin  CLDN1 hasbeen found to be highly expressed in GC and is a poor predictive disease marker by mediating tumor necrosis factorainduced cell migration enhancement of proliferation andmetastasis while SULF1 has been found to be significantlyhypomethylated causing significant downregulated proteinexpression2528 This SULF1 downregulation may be indicativeof a posttranslational modification feedback loop or degradation event via protein�protein interactions but is still unclearNot surprisingly a significant underrepresentation was notedwhen comparing publications related to these genes over publications to the commonly studied genes such as MAPKPI3K and TP53 over  total publicationsGenetic Analysis of Upregulated GC Genes Using LaurenType Classified GCsWe stratified the data sets based on the respective Lauren distinguished subtype and have highlighted the vast heterogeneticmolecular landscape within the poorly differentiated diffusewell differentiated intestinal and mixed GC subtypesTable  Poorly differentiated GC shares many similaritieswith GC overall including perturbations in various collagentranscribing genes stimulation of PI3KAKT signaling andperturbations in cellular structural components This is a dominant subtype throughout the world for reasons we have previously mentioned Due to the overabundance of collagentranscribing genes we wanted to explore whether a potentialgenetic link exists Literature search identified a study correlating EhlersDanlos syndrome EDS a disease caused bycollagen gene perturbations to the development of GC29EhlersDanlos syndrome also presents with gastrointestinalinvolvement such as increased rates of heartburn which is arisk factor for developing esophageal cancer3031 Based on thelocation of these gastric tumors within the stomach that is inthe proximal stomach near the esophagus and the connectionbetween gastric and esophageal cancers it is quite possiblethere may be a much stronger correlation between EDS anddiffuse GC than previously thoughtWe have found GC overall does not share many molecularsimilarities with the welldifferentiated subtype of GC withinthe scope of our analysis We have found only a similarityCLDN1 expression Claudin  is a gene involved in coding forthe protein involved in epithelial barrier functions and is part ofthe claudin family Within GC CLDN1 has found to be differentially expressed in GC and has been found to be upregulatedin a small patient

distinctly different but we did find similarity with THY1expression both having similar fold changes Although thisgene has not been investigated in GC it is overexpressed inthe pancreatic cancer microenvironment35 Further investigation may be needed as this gene may have importance in GCdevelopmentWe finally investigated the mixed subtype of GC a subtypethat is commonly overlooked within the

protectingtumors from 5flurouracil 5FUinduced death a chemotherapy commonly used to treat GC3738 It is likely the diffusesubtype is not the only subtype with a strong genetic link butthe mixed subtype may have a stronger genetic component thanpreviously thought We hypothesize some of the genetic diversity within GC is masked when analyzed as a whole whichfurther supports the notion of this disease being highlyheterogeneousGenetic Analysis of Downregulated GC GenesThere are about twice as many published studies looking atupregulated GC genes compared to downregulated  vs The most common

many of the interacting proteins are not aswell studied as AKT1 various genes such as MTUS1 PGAP3ALDOA and PMP22 have been shown within the literature toonly influence GC but pancreatic cancer as

Genes UsingLauren Type Classified GCsWe stratified the data sets based on the respective Lauren distinguished subtype as we did previously and have highlightedthe vast heterogenetic molecular landscape within the diffuseintestinal and mixed Table  GC subtypes All subtypes areexpectedly distinct from one another within our molecular analysis The diffuse and intestinal type GCs seem to have moreprominent downregulation of metabolism related genes suchas GSTA2 and DBT GSTA2 is involved with chemoresistancedue to the action of glutathione metabolism an antioxidant andthis observation suggests that this subtype may be more sensitiveto platinum drugs56 This overall downregulation of metabolicpathways may also point to an increase in the Warburg effectThis alternative metabolic pathway has been suggested to contribute phenotypically to high rates of invasion and aggressiveGCs57 We also observed downregulation of ADRB2 in theintestinal type GC Table  Zhang et al described ADRB2signaling as essential in GC and is likely related to stressinduced tumor induction58 They suggest treating with antagonists of ARDB2 likely will provide survival benefit This may beimportant to note and be beneficial for nonintestinal like GCsbecause there is a clear trend of significant downregulation ofthis gene   fold differenceWe next assessed the molecular aberrations in the

rheumatoid arthritis6061 Again themixed subtype is molecularly different from the intestinal anddiffuse gastric subtypes based on this genetic pathway analysiswith notably less involvement of metabolism related genesAlthough this is expected due to its difference in subtypingthe mixed gastric subtype has a much smaller representationwithin the literature than the intestinal and diffuse types and itis clear that further investigation is needed A better understanding of the diverse nature of downregulated genes in allaspects of GC is needed as a first step to identify new therapeutic options that will benefit patients with GCGastric Cancer Exhibits High Molecular DifferencesBetween GendersWithin the United States men and women older than  are athigher risk for developing GC while the male population ishigher in risk for welldifferentiated GC development than thefemale population mainly due to the protective effect of estrogen against developing H pylori induced gastric carcinogenesis62 Females have higher incidence of poorly differentiatedGCs compared to their male counterparts for reasons largelyunknown Various environmental factors play a role in diseasedevelopment as a whole including obesity smoking drinkingand a poor diet6366 A retrospective study by Kim et al hasshown that women not only have a higher incidence of diffusetype GC but have a worse overall prognosis as well as geneticdifferences compared to men including ERb expression67 suggesting a hormonal component may also be a contributing factor to this subset of disease Due to the evident genderdisparities in GC we investigated the underlying moleculardifferences between male and female patients by preformingGEO2R analysis on the GSE118916 data set Our results showstriking differences in differentially expressed genes betweenmales and femalesOverall both male and female patients with GC showed anabundance of upregulated genes Figure 2A After stratifyingbased on gender the female patients with GC have a higherabundance of upregulated genes oncogenic like genes genes greater than 5fold upregulation compared to downregulated genes Figure 2B while male patients with GC have agreater abundance of downregulated genes tumor suppressorlike genes Figure 2B This trend can also be seen from just thetop differentially expressed genes in the provided tables Current treatment options for GC are somewhat limited in achieving a longterm survival benefit and we wanted to use ourcohorts to identify whether there are differences in actionabletargets between gendersFemale Patients With GC Are Vastly UnderrepresentedWithin Clinical StudiesWe found no direct druggable targets according to the DGIdbdatabase with the top differentially expressed genes Therefore we looked further into the individual protein�proteininteraction networks using STRING database Figure 2CFBroadening the scope of our search allowed us to find manypotential druggable targets Table  We narrowed the scopeof our search to inhibitorsantagonist type compounds due tothe substantial genes found to be upregulated Many of thedruggable targets such as estimated glomerular filtration rateEGFR tyrosine

metastatic GC68 Lapatinib aTKI responsible for inhibiting HER2neu and EGFR wastested in a phase III clinical trial TyTAN Trial in Asianpatients with GC69 There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival for Paclitaxel plus Lapatinib overPaclitaxel alone70 We looked further into the patient demographics of the TyTAN trial and noticed a large underrepresentation of female patients within all arms of the study total female patients Another example of this is a trial withBortezomib which interacts with the ADAM17 pathway andhas been tried unsuccessfully in Phase II clinical trials in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic patientswith GC71 As with the Lapatinib trial this one had an overrepresentation of male patients  compared to femalepatients  A common occurrence within many of theGC clinical trials is combination of new therapies with paclitaxel or some type of Taxol We have found the female cohortto have an abundance of druggable targets interact with paclitaxel including EPB41L4B and CAPN9 Table  but largelythis demographic is underrepresented within clinical trial studies It is clear that based on the molecular profile of femalepatients with GC this issue demands further investigationMale Patients With GC May Benefit From HormoneInhibiting TherapiesAs we have previously mentioned the male cohort has anopposite molecular profile compared to the female cohort withWhen screening for actionable drug targets we limited thescope of our analysis to agonists due to the substantial geneticdownregulation already occurring naturally and notion thatmale patients with GC have an abundance of tumor suppressorlike genes In doing so we have found direct druggable targetssuch as SSTR1 and GPT Table  GPT is a gene that encodesthe alanine aminotransaminase  protein and catalyzes thereversible transamination between alanine and 2oxoglutaratewithin the tricarboxylic acid TCA cycle to generate pyruvatea TCA

syndrome  and  others1017  These  lines of evidence suggest that genetic factors play a role on keloid predispositionPathophysiology of keloidsKeloid  pathology  is  complex  involving  both genetic and environmental factors Keloids form as a result of abnormal wound healing and excessive dermal fibrosis Development of keloids has been linked to overproliferation and reduced apoptosis of dermal fibroblasts overproduction of collagen fibres and other extracellular matrix ECM components as well as abnormal ECM production and remodelling1  Various  cytokines  growth  factors and proteolytic enzymes have been implicated in the  formation  of  keloids  including  transforming growth factor TGF epidermal growth factor EGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF plateletderived growth factor PDGF connective tissue  growth  factor  CTGF  tumour  necrosis factorα  TNFα insulinlike  growth  factor1  IGF1 fibroblast growth factor FGF interleukin6  IL6  and  matrix  metalloproteinases MMPs31418  Furthermore  signalling  pathways such as Tolllike receptor signalling SMAD signalling and fibronectin have been reported to be associated with keloid development1819Histopathology of keloidsHistologically keloids comprise an abundance of unordered  dermal  collagen  and  vasculature  with high  inflammatorycell  infiltrate  and  overactive mesenchymal  cells1415  In  addition  to  collagen elastin  fibronectin  and  proteoglycans  are  deposited in excess amounts in keloid scars9 Collagen creates  frequent  crosslinks  in  ordinary  wounds whereas collagen is irregularly anised in keloids forming nodules in the dermis20 During normal Figure   Earlobe keloids as a consequence of ear piercingarise from skin trauma or inflammation and may develop  years  after  the  initial  insult  and  rarely regress2 The scar tissue extends beyond the original wound site and can be disfiguring and cause psychosocial  issues  impairing  quality  of  life3  In addition  patients  may  present  with  symptoms such as burning pain pruritus movement limitation and hyperaesthesia2AetiologyThe  aetiology  of  keloids  is  still  poorly  understood The most common regions of the skin for keloids include upper arms skin overlying joints chest shoulders and head�neck regions particularly  the  ear  lobes  Figure    The  anatomical location of a keloid appears to alter its morphological characteristics Some keloids can develop spontaneously  however  most  occur  years  after local trauma and other events including inflammation surgery burns elective cosmesis foreign body reactions acne insect bites vaccinations or mechanical force45Epidemiology and keloid geneticsThe incidence of keloids is highest among darkerpigmented  persons  of  African  Asian  and Hispanic  descent  and  is  estimated  to  be  in  the range  of  �  Males  and  females  have  an equal risk of developing keloids6 although incidence  is  slightly  increased  in  females  likely attributable to them having more cosmetic procedures  like  ear  piercing7  Persons  aged  � years  are  also  at  a  higher  risk  of  developing keloids  Additional  risk  factors  include  having blood  type  A  hyperIgE  and  hormonal  peaks during pregnancy or puberty8Familial  keloid  case  studies  and  twin  studies support  the  notion  that  genetic  factors  have  an 0cOjeh  for the treatment of keloids2627 Intralesional TAC injections have been shown to reduce scar volume and height improve scar pliability and diminish associated scar pain and itching8 as well as prevent recurrence3  Corticosteroids  have  antiinflammatory  and  antimitotic  properties1  Several  other mechanisms  have  been  reported  by  which  corticosteroids reduce keloid scar including inhibition of  fibroblast  growth  attenuation  of  procollagen and  glycosaminoglycan  synthesis  reduction  of endothelial  budding  and  enhancement  of  collagen  and  fibroblast  degeneration2829  Corticos teroids  inhibit  TGF1  expression  and  induce apoptosis in fibroblasts inhibit VEGF and alphaglobulins which are involved in the wound healing  process28�  VEGF  which  promotes angiogenesis was reported to be highly expressed in  keloid  fibroblasts  compared  to  controls  but exogenous  addition  of  the  glucocorticoid  dexamethasone  suppressed  its  expression  in  vitro32 Furthermore VEGF expression was overexpressed in  keloid  tissue  which  later  reduced  following intralesional TAC injections in vivo33TAC  is  typically  administered  at  intervals  of �  weeks  until  pruritic  and  painassociated symptoms  diminish  and  the  scar  flattens34  The dose  of  TAC  is  in  the  range  of  �  mgmL depending  on  the  size  and  anatomical  location of the lesion and the age of the patient34 TAC is used either alone as a monotherapy or in combination  with  other  treatment  modalities13  The response  rates  to  corticosteroid  injections  vary clinically  with  regression  rates  in  the  range  of �  reported  after  one  year  and  recurrence  rates  in  the  range  of  �  reported after  five  years3  Combined  therapy  comprising surgical excision followed by TAC treatment also varied  with  reported  recurrence  rates  in  the range  of  �  Previous  clinical  studies where TAC was used alone reported efficacy and good  clinical  outcome  with  this  treatment  including reduced keloid height length width related pruritus and erythema and improved pliability3637  A  recent  randomised  parallelgroup study  that  compared  the  role  of  intralesional TAC  fractional  CO2  laser  or  intralesional  verapamil  in  the  treatment  of  keloid  in    patients showed reduction in scar height vascularity and pliability in all three groups using the Vancouver Scar Scale score however pigmentation was not completely resolved with any of the treatments The  response  was  fastest  with  TAC  followed  by verapamil and laser and this was statistically significant38 However intralesional TAC in combination with other treatment modalities such as 5fluorouracil  5FU  pulsed  dye  laser  PDL surgery  interferon  IFNα2b  verapamil  and

age of patient52 These include linear closure and flap  coverage  excision  with  grafting  Wplasty and  Zplasty53  To  reduce  risk  of  keloid  recurrence  the  surgeon  performing  the  excision should establish tensionfree wound closure As a general  rule  closure  of  the  wound  should  be accomplished with minimal tension and sutures leaving everted wound borders Zplasties threelayered  sutures  subcutaneousfascial  tensile reduction  sutures  or  local  ﬂap  surgery  can  be employed  on  a  casebycase  basis5455  The  final outcome of the scar is often positively correlated with  the  experience  of  the  operating  surgeon and  technique  utilised  as  well  as  the  patients� active participation in their wound care52Siliconebased productsSince  the  1980s  siliconebased  products  have been used in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic  scars  with  silicone  gel  or  silicone  gel sheeting  considered  as  firstline  therapy  for minor keloids and hypertrophic scars2635 There are  various  other  forms  of  silicone  including creams sprays gel cushion and liquid24 The precise mechanism of action of silicone products is not fully understood but it is proposed that they enhance hydration and create an occlusive environment53 which influences fibroblast regulation and  decreases  collagen  synthesis56  Silicone  gel sheeting  has  been  shown  to  have  minimal  side effects  including  local  irritation  which  can  be resolved  quickly24  Studies  have  shown  that  the beneficial  effects  of  silicone  gel  sheets  include pain reduction tenderness and pruritus and flattening the keloid57 The silicone gel sheeting is recommended to be worn from two weeks after primary  wound  treatment  for  �  h  for  � months58Studies have demonstrated an improvement of up to  in keloid scars after using silicone gel  sheeting35  and  a  decrease  in  the  incidence rates  of  keloids  and  hypertrophic  scars  after  surgery59  In  addition  controlled  studies  have reported the clinical effectiveness of silicone gel and silicone gel sheeting in the prevention and treatment of keloids3558 However a recent metaanalysis  review60  and  Cochrane  review61  found that even though studies published data in support of the efficacy of silicone gel sheeting in the treatment  and  prevention  of  keloid  and  hypertrophic  scarring  they  provided  weak  evidence and  were  of  poor  quality60�  Therefore  given Figure   Auricular keloid surgical excision used as monotherapy Auricular keloid before a and after b surgical excisonsurgery all yielded significant improvements compared to treatment with TAC monotherapy339�Intralesional  steroid  injections  can  cause  several  adverse  side  effects  such  as  telangiectasis atrophy steroid acne pigmentary changes necrosis ulcerations and systemic side effects3 There is also  significant  pain  associated  with  intradermal corticosteroid injections that can be reduced when local anaesthetic lidocaine is administered to control the pain44 Furthermore the side effects have been reported to diminish when intralesional TAC is used in combination with 5FU45Surgical excisionSurgical excision is a traditional method of removing keloids Figure  However excision creates a new wound and can result in a similar or larger keloid47  Therefore  surgical  excision  is  not  recommended as a monotherapy as it results in high recurrence  rates  in  the  range  of  � For better postoperative surgical outcomes surgical excision is often combined with other forms of treatment  including  radiotherapy  intralesional corticosteroid  injections  IFN  injection  bleomycin cryotherapy pressure therapy and silicone gel or sheeting82649 Successful use of dermal substitutes and epidermal skin grafting with keloid excision has also been reported50 A recent case series study  in  which    patients  with  anterior  chest wall keloids were given a treatment protocol consisting  of  complete  excision  Zplasty  postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and postsurgical wound selfmanagement  reported  excellent  outcomes with a recurrence rate of only  The use of steroid tape and injections helped to resolve the recurrence of keloids51 0cOjeh  the  lack  of  substantial  evidence  welldesigned clinical trials and studies are required to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of siliconebased products in preventing and treating keloidsPressure therapyPressure therapy has been used to treat and manage keloids and hypertrophic scars for decades3563 It has been routinely employed as firstline treatment  in  the  treatment  of  hypertrophic  scarring resulting  from  burns64  The  underlying  mechanisms of action of compression techniques remain unclear however several hypotheses exist some of which include increased pressure to the scar surface  reduces  perfusion  and  decreased  oxygen  to the location of injury reduces collagen synthesis It is  also  thought  that  pressure  increases  apoptosis reduces  scar  hydration  stabilising  mast  cells  and decreases angiogenesis165 The application of pressure can be achieved using a variety of materials such as adhesive plaster moulds pressure earrings and  customfitted  splints16  which  have  improved scar cosmesis and rates of keloid recurrence66� A continuous  pressure  of  �  mmHg  preferably at the lower range soon after wound reepithelialisation for � h per day for   months is recommended166869 The efficacy of pressure therapy depends mainly on the anatomical location of the scar with trunk and limb areas being more appropriate  sites  for  pressure  therapy  In  addition  a pressure garment is predominantly used for auricular  keloids  where  pressure  clips  are  commonly utilised  after  surgery6670  As  an  adjuvant  therapy this form of pressure garment has also been successfully  used  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of keloids6667 In contrast a metaanalysis review that analysed  the  effectiveness  of  pressure  garment therapy  for  the  prevention  of  abnormal  scarring after  burn  injury  was  unable  to  demonstrate  any beneficial effects of pressure garment therapy on prevention  or  treatment  of  abnormal  scarring59 Notwithstanding success rates of pressure therapy are contingent upon patient compliance69 which can sometimes be low due to discomfort Overall pressure therapy is tolerated better and is devoid of the pain often associated with intralesional therapies and hence can be considered as a good adjuvant therapy for keloid scarsRadiotherapyIn  the treatment of keloids using superficial Xray irradiation was first described71 Since then it has been used less frequently as a monotherapy and more widely as an effective adjunct treatment after surgical excision72� with success rates in the range  of  �  and  recurrence  rates  of about  Radioactive skin patches have also been used in combination with other treatment modalities  for  keloids7879  Radiotherapy  is  most commonly used � h after surgical excision7480 and acts by suppressing angiogenesis and inhibiting ﬁbroblast activity1 Decreased fibroblast proliferation  induced  cell  senescence  and  apoptosis leading to reduction in collagen production and suppression  of  keloid  development  have  also been reported81�Different  radiotherapy  modalities  have been  used  after  surgical  excision  including electron  beam  radiotherapy  brachytherapy superﬁcial and orthovoltage radiotherapy with varying  degrees  of  success84  Mankowski  et a0 al conducted  a  literature  review  of    studies  to compare  the  clinical  outcome  of  different forms of radiation treatment used for the management of keloids77 The metaanalysis demonstrated  that  radiation  used  as  monotherapy yielded higher rates of recurrence  compared  to  combinational  therapy  with  postsurgery excision  Comparison between the different  radiationbased  treatments  revealed that the lowest rate of recurrence was observed with  brachytherapy    followed  jointly  by Xray    and  electron  beam    The authors  also  reported  that  the  rate  of  recurrence was dependent on anatomical site of the keloid  with  chest  keloids  having  the  highest recurrence rate73The  adverse  effects  of  radiotherapy  often linked  with  dose  of  radiation  used  can  be grouped into acute skin reactions and late complications Acute reactions arise as early as seven days after keloid treatment and include oedema necrosis  ulceration  desquamation  erythema and  pigmentary  changes  with  the  latter  two being  the  most  common  Late  complications which include changes in pigment atrophy telangiectasis  and  alopecia  may  present  several weeks after radiotherapy Emollient and steroid ointment used after radiotherapy can help alleviate the side effects19 A recommended radiation dose   Gy over several sessions can also minimise  adverse  effects1980  Radiotherapy  carries  a risk of malignancy8586 Therefore caution should be used in radiationvulnerable sites such as the head  neck  thyroid  and  breast  and  in  patients aged   years2 Protecting fragile ans and selecting  the  most  appropriate  sitedependent dose protocol can help minimise further complications of radiotherapy87 0c Scars Burns  HealingCryotherapyCryotherapy is a lowtemperature treatment that causes  vascular  damage  resulting in  tissue  necrosis88 It has been used to treat keloids as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment  methods  such  as  intralesional  steroid  injections89  Various  delivery  methods  used  for cryotherapy include spray and contact probes or the intralesionalneedle  cryoprobe  method Compared to contact and spray methods intralesionalneedle  cryoprobe  was  found  to  be  the most effective method in treating keloid scars90 Positive outcomes were observed in a number of studies  that  used  liquid  nitrogen  and  cryotherapy to treat keloids with success rates in the range of ��External  cryotherapy  has  been  associated with several side effects including hypopigmentation  blistering  pain  delayed  healing  and  infection9093 Moreover larger keloids have been shown to need multiple cryotherapy sessions9093 To  minimise  side  effects  intralesional  cryotherapy was introduced and there are now a number of  nitrogenbased  cryodevices  that  have  been described for the treatment of keloid scars with two  commercially  available  a  liquid  nitrogenbased device88 and an argon gasbased device94 The  intralesional  cryotherapy  was  designed  to overcome the hypopigmentation seen mostly in darkskinned individuals with external cryotherapy It works by destroying the core of the keloid sparing the surface epithelial cells including melanocytes9596  As  a  result  it  enhances  volume decrease  while  minimising  the  risk  of  hypopigmentation and other surface reactions90 A recent comprehensive  review  based  on  the  preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalysis was performed to investigate the efficacy of  intralesional  cryotherapy  on  keloid  scars90 The review of eight studies that met the inclusion criteria  revealed  that  average  scar  volume decreased  in  the  range  of  �  but  complete eradication of the scar on average was lacking Recurrence of keloid scars was in the range of  �  The  authors  also  reported  that patients�  complaints  of  pain  and  pruritus  was

1980s97 Since then different systems have been used for the treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars4898 These lasers target skin chromophores like haemoglobin and melanin based on the principle of selective photothermolysis99  Lasers  can  be  classified  as ablative  and  nonablative  The  most  common ablative  lasers  include  the  2940nm  erbiumdoped  yttrium  aluminium  garnet  ErYAG laser and the 10600nm carbon dioxide CO2 laser These emit a laser beam that is absorbed by  water  in  the  skin  leading  to  local  tissue destruction  and  reduction  of  lesion  volume3 Common  examples  of  nonablative lasers include 585nm or 595nm PDLs 1064nm neodymiumdopedyttriumaluminiumgarnet NdYAG neodymiumdopedvanadate  NdVan  laser  and    nm Qswitched  NdYAG  laser  with  low  fluence100 These lasers induce thermal injury to the scar�s microvasculature  leading  to  thrombosis  and ischaemia  which  result  in  collagen  denaturation and collagen fibre realignment101�532nm laser Laser  therapy  requires  several  treatments  at intervals of � weeks depending on scar type and type  of  laser  used98104  with  possible  side  effects including itching pigmentary changes blister formation  and  postoperative  purpura98  The  use  of the  nonfractional  vascular  �  nm  PDL  in the  treatment  of  keloid  and  hypertrophic  scars has been welldocumented105� and has response rates in the range of � PDL monotherapy has been shown to be effective108110 as well as CO2 laser monotherapy38111112 In a clinical study where  patients with moderate to severe keloids were  treated  with  highenergy  pulsed  CO2  laser the  treatment  was  efficacious  and  welltolerated with minimal side effects112 In other studies where CO2 laser ablation was compared with other forms of treatment CO2 laser was as efficient as the other forms38111 It must be noted however that these studies are small and randomised controlled studies are lacking98Laser therapy such as PDL CO2 and NdYAG have  been  associated  with  a  high  rate  of  recurrence at � months111113� However optimal results  can  be  achieved  with  combination  treatment  especially  with  intralesional  TAC  injections116�  Kumar  and  coworkers  conducted  a cohort  study  on    patients  with  keloids  previously treated with an NdYAG laser and reported complete scar resolution and flattening in seven patients  only  when  intralesional  TAC  was  used after  laser  therapy41  Moreover  combined  therapy  with  PDL  and  TAC119  and  PDL  TAC  and 5FU36  were  shown  to  produce  better  clinical results In a recent study that evaluated and compared  the  efficacy  of  combination  therapy  of 0cOjeh  scars statistically fractional CO2 laser and intralesional TAC injection or TAC injection

Technology  identify susceptible individuals and diagnostic prognostic and treatment approaches for patientsCurrent  diagnostic  approaches  predominantly  involve established virological procedures such as nucleic acid hybridization techniques reversetranscriptase PCR [RTPCR] and recombinase  polymerase  amplification  RPA  as  well  as immunologic  approaches like  antibody  assays  Each approach  boasts  unique  strengths  and  weaknesses  For instance while RTPCR demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity  its  capabilities  have  been  severely  limited  for practical reasons during this current pandemic due to global shortages of skilled personnel reagents and equipment and a processing time of up to  days By contrast immunologic tests such as antibody assays are rapid and require minimal equipment  but  they  have  limited  utility  in  the  context  of acute diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infections This is because it can take several days to weeks following symptom onset for a patient to mount a detectable antibody response6Immunological tools in research include enzymelinked immunosorbent  assays  ELISAs  flow  cytometry  and mass cytometry CyTOF Imaging techniques for pathological analyses include conventional approaches such as hematoxylin�eosin HE staining immunohistochemical IHC  staining  or  transmission  electron  microscopy TEM and RNAscope Each of these methods is used to examine the pathophysiology underlying COVID19 from a different perspective each with their own advantages and disadvantages  For  example  it  has  been  established  that the entry of SARSCoV2 intro cells depends on the binding of viral proteins with the human receptor angiotensinconverting  enzyme    ACE2  receptors7  Additionally evidence  shows  that  the  type  II  transmembrane  protease TMPRSS2 is also essential for viral entry by priming the viral spike protein for binding to ACE28 Therefore considerable  research  efforts  employing  different  techniques have  been  directed  at  mapping  the  distribution  of ACE2 and  TMPRSS2  in  tissues  and  their  relationship  to  the observed manifestations of disease Together the combination of these approaches has advanced our understanding of COVID19In  this  review  we  discuss  the  current  approaches  in COVID19 diagnosis and research with a focus on findings from  virological  and  pathological  imaging  methods  We also  discuss  immunological  methods  which  are  increasingly  recognized  as  an  integral  component  of  the  disease processDiagnosticsThe most common symptoms of COVID19 at initial presentation  are  nonspecific  and  include  a  high  fever  a  new and  persistent  cough  and  fatigue910  Due  to  similarities between the clinical characteristics of COVID19 and many other respiratory illnesses the accurate and early detection of infection is pivotal for outbreak control Any delays in diagnosis are increasingly measured in lives lostAccording to the World Health anization WHO the immediate goal for research into COVID19 diagnostics is the  development  of  RNA  assays  antibody  and  antigen assays  and  pointofcare  detection11  The  intermediateterm priority would be their integration into multiplex diagnostic  platforms  while  the  longterm  goal  would  be  the investigation of prognostic markersIn this section we summarize the current and emerging diagnostic  tools  for  SARSCoV2  through  the  lens  of immunologyLabBased TestsRTPCR  Molecular  Testing  The  detection  of  viral  nucleic acids by RTPCR is the primary method used to confirm a suspected  case  of  COVID19  RTPCR  and  other  nucleic acid hybridization techniques are an integral part of virology and are applied in a broad range of settings including screening  diagnosis  informing  medical  and  therapeutic decisions and assessing cure rates from therapy12 Chinese officials released the genomic sequence of SARSCoV2 to public databases early in the course of the outbreak13 and the WHO has since published seven protocols for RTPCRbased diagnostics Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of RTPCR it is regarded as the �gold standard� for virus detection14 There are two essential steps in the process  viral RNA extraction and  PCR amplification and  probebased  detection  Multiple  largescale  highthroughput  instruments  are  available  for  automating  both steps such as the Roche Cobas  system which has an advertised throughput of  tests per  hours15However RTPCRbased testing is costly and timeconsuming requiring up to  days using centralized laboratory equipment and skilled personnel furthermore global supply  chain  challenges  have  led  to  significant  shortages  of essential reagents Lastly falsenegative results due to low sample  volumes  variable  sampling  techniques  and  sampling  locations  sample  degradation  during  transportation andor improper nucleic acid extraction are a concern16� In  addition  the  differences  in  detectable  viral  material  in different sampling locations eg nasopharyngeal vs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF] vs rectal samples might also  explain  the  falsepositive  RTPCR  results  on  repeat testing  in  �recovered�  COVID19  patients  Indeed  one postmortem case study revealed residual virus in lung tissue despite  consecutive  negative  results  on  PCR  testing  from nasopharyngeal  swabs19  Separately  Winichakoon  et  al outlined a case of repeatedly negative nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal  swabs  in  a  clinically  deteriorating  patient where only a BALF PCR test returned positive20Given the high expression of ACE2 on alveolar epithelial cells and negative expression on nasal oral and nasopharynx  0cTan et al cells21  it  would  be  prudent  to  perform  bronchoalveolar lavage  on  patients  to  rule  out  falsenegative  results  from swabs of upper respiratory tract samples20LabBased  Immunological  Assays  In  contrast  to  RTPCR techniques  that  detect  viral  nucleic  acids  serological  and immunological  assays  aim  to  detect  antibodies  against SARSCoV2 or antigenic proteins in infected individuals Neutralization assays are considered the gold standard for assessing  neutralizing  protective  antibodies22  however these  assays  require  specialized  biosafety  level    BSL3 facilities  and  still  take  several  days  to  complete Another type of labbased antibody assay is the traditional ELISA which  detects  all  binding  antibodies  The  four  principal types of ELISA are direct indirect competitive and sandwich  ELISA  the  indirect  ELISA  is  the  most  common method  for  determining  antibody  concentrations  ELISAs have  good  concordance  with  neutralization  assays  for  the detection of antibody responses in SARSCoV223 Unfortunately  both  methods  require  skilled  operators  and  are limited by low throughput due to the absence of fully automated systemsSerological  diagnostics  offer  several  advantages  Re quirements  for  specimen  quality  are  comparatively  less stringent  than  for  nucleic  acid  tests  as  the  antibodies  are uniformly  distributed  in  the  serum24  Consequently  sampling  location  concerns  do  not  apply  here  Furthermore good correlation between IgG ELISAs performed on both conventional serum samples and plasma samples have been reported25 of which the latter may be conveniently obtained from residual blood submitted for other routine laboratory testsOne pitfall of antibody assays is their limited utility early in the course of any infection Sparse data are available with regard to the antibody responses produced by patients with COVID19 It seems that SARSCoV2 IgM is detectable at a  median  of    days  after  symptom  onset  while  IgG  is detectable  after    days26  with  the  seroconversion  rate approaching    by  day    An  Italian  research  group noted  that  the  performance  of  a  commercial  VivaDiag COVID19 IgMIgG test was very poor with a sensitivity of only  and a negative predictive value of  in a cohort of suspected COVID19 patients in the emergency room setting27 As such we believe that for now RTPCR testing  is  likely  more  appropriate  for  diagnosing  acute COVID19Notably  a  longitudinal  study  examining  the  IgGIgM profiles  of    patients  found  that  seroconversion  for  IgG and IgM occurred in no specific chronological order with a median  of    days  after  symptom  onset28  all  patients achieved  seroconversion  by  day    Consequently  the detection of both IgG and IgM simultaneously rather than one antibody alone would be idealAnother  concern  surrounding  serologic  diagnostics  is the production of falsepositive results from crossreactivity due to the high prevalence of the four endemic human coronaviruses  in  the  human  population  In  SARSCoV2 the spike S protein which includes two regions S1 and S2  and  the  nucleocapsid  N  protein  NP  are  the  major immunogens29 and therefore most diagnostics rely on the detection  of  antibodies  specific  for  these  antigens  One work  suggests  that  of  the  possible  targets  the  S1  subunit antigen is more specific than either the whole S antigen or the N antigen for detecting SARSCoV2 antibodies with no crossreactivity to other coronaviruses except for SARSCoV23  Given  that  only    SARSCoV  infections  were recorded worldwide30 the risk of false positives from this crossreactivity  is  miniscule  However  NP  ELISAs  are more sensitive than S1 in detecting antibodies in those with a mild infection23 Importantly as in SARSCoV most of the neutralizing antibodies are directed against the S protein31  of  which  S1  contains  a  receptorbinding  domain RBD responsible for making contact with ACE2 to facilitate  viral  entry7  Thus  theoretically  only  diagnostics  that detect S1specific antibodies are suitable to infer immunity to  COVID19  this  fact  is  corroborated  by  evidence  that antiS RBD but not antiNP IgG levels correlated with neutralizing antibody titers in sera from a cohort of  recovered patients32 The number of commercial antibody assays is  growing  detecting  either  antiNP  antibodies  antiS1S antibodies  or  both  there  is  also  large  variation  in  their claimed sensitivities and specificities33 Based on the available evidence an ideal serological assay would be a combined test that simultaneously detects both antibodies to NP and S1 antigens assessment of antiNP antibodies has good sensitivity and would be best suited for supporting the diagnosis  of  infection  while  the  additional  antiS1  antibody assay would allow for the determination of immunityRapid TestsPointofCare RTPCR Tests  A small number of commercial pointofcare tests utilizing RTPCR have been developed These typically involve the same methodology as conventional RTPCR but implemented with automated and portable  benchtopsized  instruments  that  can  be  operated closer  to  patient  care  settings  than  a  centralized  laboratory  A  prominent  example  is  Cepheid�s  Xpert  Xpress SARSCoV2 run on the Gene Xpert platform This apparatus can provide a result within  min Others include the MesaBioTech Accula Test and MicrosensDx RapiPrep COVID19 Despite displaying good sensitivity and specificity  these  instruments  are  generally  limited  by  a  very low  throughput  of  only  one  to  four  tests  per  run  per machine34 and as such are only suited to small laboratories or clinics 0c SLAS

offer the benefits of rapid diagnostic testing at a low cost These assays do not require specialized equipment or expertise35 and are thus excellent candidates for  pointofcare  testing  or  deployment  on  a  large  scale This an area of intense interest with governments worldwide  aiming  to  order  millions  of  tests  to  inform  policy makers about attack rates in their populations36 LFIAs are predominantly  singleuse  kits  designed  for  pointofcare use while CLIAs are fully automated analyzers that permit very high testing throughputUnfortunately  these  tests  do  not  quantify  the  antibody titers  and  the  performance  of  LFIAs  has  been  called  into question one evaluation of nine commercial LFIAs reported a sensitivity ranging from only  to  versus RTPCR and    to    versus  ELISA37  Meanwhile  the  performance of CLIAs is superior with good sensitivity and specificity levels similar to those of ELISA38 Otherwise these tests  share  the  same  advantages  and  drawbacks  as  the  0cTan et al Table   Summary of Diagnostic Approaches for COVID19CategoryType of TestTypical Test Result TimeCharacteristicsExamplesVirologicmolecular RTPCRDaysGold

discussed above The characteristics and unique advantages and disadvantages of these different methodologies are outlined in Table Antigen Assays  An alternative approach to immunological assays is to directly detect SARSCoV2 viral antigens Several  commercial  pointofcare  antigen  tests  are  available but their performance remains to be evaluated These tests may be suitable for making an early diagnosis and are deployable as pointofcare assays However they face the same  sampling  limitations  as  RTPCR  and  are  hypothetically hampered by limited sensitivity due to the omission of  an  amplification  process  unlike  nucleic  acid  testing For  example  one  multicenter  study  evaluating  the  Corisbio COVID19 Ag RespiStrip a lateral flow assay for the SARSCoV2 NP reported a test sensitivity of only Rapid  NonPCR  Molecular  Testing  Nucleic  acid  testing using nonPCR methods is an emerging approach for rapid diagnostics  and  several  assays  have  received  Food  and Drug Administration FDA emergency use authorization which  facilitates  the  distribution  of  unapproved  medical products or the offlabel use of approved medical products  when  certain  criteria  are  met  These  methods  share high sensitivity and specificity on par with RTPCR but with  the  principal  advantages  of  more  rapid  testing  at  a lower cost40�LAMP Fig  is one such novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that does not require a thermal cycler One example is the ID NOW COVID19 test from Abbott Diagnostics which can deliver results in just  min43 and uses  a  lightweight  portable  instrument  allowing  onsite testing of swab samples However it has a limited throughput of only one sample per runThe CRISPR enzymes Cas12 and Cas13 have also been adapted  for  rapid  nucleic  acid  sensing    Fig    The DETECTR  assay  by  Mammoth  Biosciences45  as  well  as the  SHERLOCK  assay  by  Sherlock  Biosciences46  potentially offers sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of RTPCR but can be completed in  h However these approaches are still in the early stages of commercialization and current applications are available only as test kits to be run in labs while pointofcare versions exist as proofofconcept demonstrations47 Nonetheless their inherent characteristics hold great potential for diagnosis in the futurePrognostication of DiseaseProfiling  of  Genetic  Susceptibility  Work  is  in  progress  to ascertain the possible genetic basis for the apparent variations in COVID19 susceptibility and disease severity Cao et al

immunological methods would be to measure markers that enable prognostication  in  COVID19  Higher  titers  of  antibodies against  SARSCoV2  have  been  associated  with  more severe  disease2350  similar  to  previous  studies  in  Middle East  respiratory  syndrome  MERS�CoV51  ELISA  has been used to provide a quantitative measurement of serum and  plasma  IgM  and  IgG  antibodies  By  monitoring  the kinetics of IgM and IgG antibodies specific to the N and S proteins on SARSCoV2 it was found that intensive care unit ICU patients had a significantly lower level of SIgG within    weeks  of  symptom  onset  but  a  higher  level  of NIgG antibodies compared with nonICU patients52 This finding highlights the possible utility of SIgG and NIgG as a prognostic tool for COVID19 patientsThe Ddimer level which consists of crosslinked fibrin degradation products that reflect ongoing blood clot formation  and  breakdown  activity  in  the  body  is  another  proposed  prognostic  marker  Modern  commercial  assays  for Ddimers are based on monoclonal antibodies employing either ELISA or microlatex agglutination assays53 Reports have emerged that elevated Ddimer levels suggestive of a hypercoagulable state are associated with drastically worse outcomes A Chinese group reported that Ddimer levels of ��  �gmL  on  admission  were  associated  with  a   times  increased  mortality  relative  to  Ddimer  levels  of   �gmL in a cohort of  COVID19 patients54 This finding of Ddimer levels as a negative prognostic marker was also noted in other studies conducted in China455 and the Netherlands56Similarly  interleukin  IL6  a  key  component  of  the cytokine release syndrome is another marker measured by ELISA  and  has  been  described  to  independently  predict adverse outcomes in COVID195758 Tumor necrosis factor alpha  TNFα  another  important  proinflammatory  cytokine  has  also  been  found  to  be  strongly  correlated  with Figure   Chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay CLIA SARSCoV2 antigens will capture IgM and IgG antibodies from the sample serum Secondary antibodies that are conjugated with horseradish peroxidase HRP bind to

populations  but  reported  no  direct  evidence supporting  the  existence  of  S  proteinbindingresistant ACE2 mutants48 out of  identified protein altering variants Separately Stawiski et al analyzed ACE2 polymorphisms  within  a  much  larger  population  dataset  spanning more than  population groups across the world and performed structural predictions to identify variants that might confer protection or rather increase susceptibility to SARSCoV2 S protein binding49 Out of a total of  identified proteinaltering ACE2 variants  variants were predicted to increase susceptibility while  variants were speculated to  confer  protection  however  the  degree  of  changes  in receptor�virus binding interactions for each structural variant was not quantified These findings represent significant developments in our understanding of population risk profiles for COVID19 and future coronavirus infections 0cTan et al endan  damage  and  mortality  even  after  adjusting  for disease severity scores59 Gao et al examined both IL6 and Ddimer levels they proposed a panel comprising tandem testing of these two markers which produced a sensitivity of    and  specificity  of    in  early  prediction  of severe COVID1958 Elevated troponin levels a marker of myocardial  injury  measured  with  ELISA  immunoassays also strongly predict progression to death in patients with severe illness60 These results suggest that multiplex cytokine and serum marker profiling will be a powerful tool in stratifying  patients  that  may  guide  clinical  decisions  and resource allocationSummary  In sum rapid progress has been made in diagnostics for COVID19 Yet the race against time continues for researchers and biotechnology firms to develop rapid costeffective  and  reliable  test  kits  that  can  be  deployed on a large scale At the time of writing labbased RTPCR testing  has  been  the  dominant  diagnostic  approach  but alternative molecular approaches like isothermal amplification and CRISPR which have clear advantages are on the horizon Immunological tests such as CLIA and LFIA will become increasingly important because of the urgent need for  pointofcare  diagnostics  for  mass  testing  of  infected asymptomatic individuals and their close contacts and will be  valuable  in  complementing  molecular  approaches  for confirming  infection  Furthermore  immunological  assays will  be  in  great  demand  by  policy  makers  worldwide  for the  assessment  of  immunity  to  COVID19  However  the performance of these serological tests varies significantly particularly  their  degree  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  we believe that caution must be taken in the interpretation of these tests Detailed evaluation of the reliability of serological tests will be a key area for future research Lastly given the  importance  of  techniques  like  ELISA  in  prognosticating COVID19 immunological methods will undoubtedly occupy a crucial role in achieving all levels of the WHO�s short medium and longterm diagnostic goalsCOVID19 Research ToolsImmunological ApproachesCOVID19  infection  has  a  poor  prognosis  in  individuals with  comorbidities  and  abnormal  immune  functions Although  research  surrounding  COVID19  is  still  in  its infancy several studies have revealed lymphopenia and the cytokine  storm  as  underlying  mechanisms  correlating  to disease progression Here we discuss the various immunological techniques involved in assessing host immunity in COVID19 patientsELISA  As  discussed  ELISA  has  also  been  used  to  detect the  inflammatory  cytokines  implicated  in  the  cytokine storm seen in patients with severe respiratory failure due to COVID19  One  study  found  that  the  immune  dysregulation in patients with severe respiratory failure was due to a significantly  increased  production  of  IL6  and  defective lymphoid function because of an IL6mediated decrease in HLADR  expression  on  CD14  monocytes  Interestingly interferongamma  IFNγ  levels  were  below  the  detection level in these patients suggesting that T helper Th  cells are  unlikely  to  be  major  players  in  the  overinflammatory response  of  severe  patients61  A  similar  observation  was made in a separate study whereby inflammatory cytokines that mediate major immune responses such as TNFα and IL1β  were  not  significantly  elevated  in  ICU  patients62 These findings demonstrate that the immunophenotype of patients with COVID19 can vary depending on presently unclear host immune factors and the severity of their condition This  relationship  between  disease  severity  and  cytokine storm has also been highlighted in other studies that found  a  significantly  elevated  plasma  concentration  of granulocyte  colonystimulating  factor  GCSF  IP10 CCL2 and CCL3 in ICU patients compared with nonICU patients63ELISA is also being used as a companion diagnostic tool for therapeutic purposes In a study that explored the use of convalescent plasma therapy from donors as a form of treatment in severe COVID19 ELISA was used to assess the neutralizing activity of the RBDspecific IgM and IgG antibodies found in the donor convalescent plasma64 After the transfusion was complete ELISA was also used to detect IgG  IgM  and  neutralizing  antibody  titers  in  the  sera  of patients to assess the response to treatment65EnzymeLinked Immunosorbent Spot  Enzymelinked immunosorbent spot ELISPOT is a sensitive immunoassay that quantitatively measures cytokinesecreting cells at the singlecell level providing insight into immunerelated cellular activities66 Hence it is a promising tool for characterizing specific Tcell  immunity  in  COVID19  patients  By  IFNγ ELISPOT  analysis  it  was  revealed  that  convalescent COVID19  patients  had  significantly  increased  levels  of IFNγsecreting T cells when compared with healthy donors A  significant  correlation  between  neutralizing  antibody titers and NPspecific T cells was identified in these patients suggesting  that  a  combination  of  humoral  and  cellular immunity  is  integral  to  clearing  SARSCoV2  Interestingly  it  was  noted  that  in  convalescent  patients    weeks IFNγsecreting  Tcell  numbers  had postdischarge decreased suggesting that they may not be maintained for a prolonged period of time even in recovered patients67ELISPOT is also serving a vital role in vaccine development through the detection of potential Tcell epitopes in  the  S  protein  RBD  of  SARSCoV268  One  study  was able  to  harness  ELISPOT  assays  to  identify  three  Tcell epitopes that induced a strong adaptive immune response  0c SLAS Technology  postimmunization demonstrating the promise of ELISPOT assays  in  the  area  of  vaccine  development32  Recently ELISPOT has also been applied to assess the immunogenicity of newly developed vaccines One such study successfully  utilized  an  IFNγ  ELISPOT  assay  to  evaluate Tcell responses to a new SARSCoV2 vaccine in murine splenocytes and rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs The promising findings from this animal study informed the start of a phase I clinical trial with  the  same  vaccine  highlighting  the  usefulness  of ELISPOT in assessing immune responses to new vaccines and promoting vaccine development69Flow Cytometry  Unlike ELISA and ELISPOT flow cytometry determines the number of cytokinesecreting cells and has the capacity to immunophenotype based on surface and intracellular markers70 In relation to the current pandemic this technique enables the detection sorting and analysis of multiple subpopulations of immune cells specific to COVID Using flow cytometry researchers detected a cytotoxic immune  environment  in  patient  blood  samples  despite  a reduction in the overall lymphocyte population71� As part of the SARSCoV2 antiviral response peripheral lymphocytes  retain  the  capacity  to  activate  and  differentiate  into subpopulations  such  as  antibodysecreting  cells  CD3�CD19CD27hiCD38hi follicular T cells CD4CXCR5ICOSPD1  CD4 Th  cells  CD38HLADRCD4  cytotoxic T Tc cells CD38HLADRCD8 and regulatory T  Treg  cells  CD3CD4CD25CD127�  These  Tc cells harbor large amounts of cytotoxic granules while CD4 Th  cells  skewed  toward  a  proinflammatory Th1  and  Th17 phenotype727375 The overall hyperinflammation and cytotoxic environment supports the notion that a cytokine storm could be liable for the multisystemic insults in patients with severe COVID19Elicitation of antiviral Tcell responses specific to SARSCoV2 is of utmost importance to establishing viral control Many studies have demonstrated robust antiviral responses however there is no known set of markers reported to identify  SARSCoV2specific  T  cells  Collectively  most groups  have  characterized  SARSCoV2specific  T  cells based on HLADR CD38 CD69

adults with HCC are likely to have additional comorbidities such as cardiovascular or pulmonary disease [] and it is not uncommon for patients with HCC to have multiple comorbidities [] Liver cirrhosis with compromised liver function and decreased hepatic reserve is a major risk factor for HCC development Other HCCrelated comorbidities include hepatitis B virushepatitis C virus infection alcoholic liver disease NASH and diabetes [] In addition metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperlipidemia and hypertension is linked to development of NAFLD which may progress to NASH cirrhosis and finally HCC [] For patients with HCC assessment of liver function is a key step in treatment decisionmaking [] Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are predominantly excluded from clinical trials in HCC therefore treatment of these patients is complicated by a lack of prospective clinical data as well as competing comorbidities []Although the number of patients with HCC and prior an transplant is limited these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and treatment is complicated by the need for immunosuppression TKIs may be used to treat posttransplant HCC recurrence although supporting data are limited The use of TKIs in these patients is complex so treatment decisions should involve collaboration between the oncology and transplant medicine care teams The use of sorafenib in patients receiving mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitorbased immunosuppression has been associated with an increased risk of fatal bleeding [ ] Immunotherapies are associated with an increased risk of an rejection in posttransplant patients []   Cabozantinib Clearance and a0ExposureTKIs are associated with high interpatient variability in clearance and exposure which may affect both efficacy and tolerability This variability may be due to a variety of factors including genetic background drug�drug interactions drugfood interactions and renal or hepatic impairment [] As evidenced by exposureresponse modeling patients with low clearance of cabozantinib may have higher exposure and an increased risk of developing certain AEs [ ] Awareness of these nuances may help clinicians to mitigate their effects thereby balancing efficacy with tolerability   Hepatic and a0Renal ImpairmentAccording to pharmacokinetic analyses of patients with HCC and other tumor types mild hepatic impairment is predicted to have a minimal effect on cabozantinib exposure [] therefore adjustment of the recommended 60mg starting dose is not necessary for patients with Child�Pugh A 0cliver function [ ] Data on the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib in patients with moderate ChildPugh B or severe Child�Pugh C hepatic impairment are limited [] As per the US Food and Drug Administration FDA prescribing information the starting dose of cabozantinib should be reduced to  mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment while cabozantinib is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [] Note that the European Summary of Product Characteristics SmPC does not recommend dose adjustments for moderate hepatic impairment owing to limited data [] For patients with HCC increased exposure due to hepatic impairment should be considered if intolerable AEs develop and dose modification undertaken as recommended Fig a0 [ ] Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment owing to the potential for increased exposure although no dose adjustments are necessary Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment owing to lack of data on safety and efficacy in this population [  ]   Drug�Drug and a0Drug�Food InteractionsGiven the range of comorbidities that may exist in patients with advanced HCC it is important to review all concomitant medications for potential interactions prior to initiation of treatment with cabozantinib Certain medications and foods have been shown to modulate the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib which may in turn impact exposure levels efficacy and risk of AEs Cabozantinib is metabolized in the liver primarily by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 CYP3A4 [] therefore CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may impact exposure examples of CYP3A4 inducersinhibitors are shown in Electronic Supplementary Table a0 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitorsinducers should be avoided in patients receiving cabozantinib If concomitant administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary then the cabozantinib Recommended dose at initiation  mg Except for�

if strong CYP3A4 inducers need to be coadministered [ ]Cabozantinib should not be taken with any food as this may affect absorption [] The label recommends that cabozantinib be taken at least  h before or at least  h after eating [] Grapefruit and grapefruit juice are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and should be avoided [ ]Cabozantinib may be used with caution in patients who are receiving concurrent antiarrhythmics or other QTprolonging agents [] This is based on a study of patients with MTC who received a daily 140mg capsule dose of cabozantinib recommended for this indication in which the mean deltadelta QT interval was increased by approximately � a0ms with upper  CIs not exceeding  ms [] Such an increase is within the range considered to be acceptable for oncology drugs in this setting [] No patient in the aforementioned study or in CELESTIAL had a confirmed QTcF QT corrected using Fridericia�s method a0 ms [] which is considered clinically significant [] For patients receiving cabozantinib monitoring with periodic electrocardiogram and electrolyte measurements may be advisable particularly in patients with risk factors such as cardiac disease or a prior history of QT prolongation [] Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors PPIs such as esomeprazole does not affect cabozantinib exposure levels [] However PPIs may cause hypomagnesemia which is linked to an increased risk of QT prolongation [] Therefore coadministration of PPIs and cabozantinib should be undertaken with caution following an individualized assessment of the patient�s baseline magnesium levels and concomitant medications that may also influence QT   Pretreatment AssessmentsGiven the heterogeneity of the HCC patient population and the complexity associated with comorbidities and concomitant medications all patients should undergo a comprehensive assessment of medical history prior to initiation of treatment with cabozantinib Ideally the multidisciplinary care team should include an oncology pharmacist [] A �brown bag� medication review should be carried out prior to treatment initiation [] whereby the patient brings in all current medications including overthecounter medicines vitamins herbal remedies etc Therapeutic duplications should be eliminated for example concomitant PPIs and histamine H2 antagonists H2 blockers Switching and deprescribing should be considered where possible to minimize the risk of drugdrug interactions   Adverse Event ManagementThe AE profile of cabozantinib is generally similar to that of other VEGFRtargeting TKIs with GIrelated AEs fatigue PPE and hypertension being the most common AEs [] Other AEs that occur less frequently can also have a significant impact on quality of life QoL and treatment adherence such as mucosal inflammation [] Hepatobiliary AEs such as elevated AST alanine aminotransferase ALT and bilirubin are particularly relevant in the context of advanced HCC and need to be carefully monitoredProphylactic and supportive care measures for the more common cabozantinibassociated AEs grade  or tolerable grade  are outlined in Tables a0    and discussed in the upcoming sections Symptom gradings are summarized in Electronic Supplementary Table a0 Dose interruption is recommended for management of intolerable grade  AEs not resolved with supportive care measures or for any grade  AEs Fig a0 [ ] Cabozantinib may be reinitiated at a reduced dose once the event resolves to grade �� a0   Palmar�Plantar ErythrodysesthesiaPPE is one of the more common events associated with anticancer therapies including VEGFRtargeting multikinase inhibitors [�] PPE is characterized by pain redness tingling and swelling of hands and feet [] Presentation may vary according to the etiologic agent PPE induced by TKIs is typically localized to pressurebearing areas in contrast to that caused by chemotherapy which has a more diffuse pattern It has been hypothesized that inhibition of multiple angiogenic pathways by TKIs may compromise repair of capillary microtrauma in areas exposed to mechanical stress such as the hands and feet [ ] Although not lifethreatening PPE can rapidly progress to a debilitating condition negatively impacting QoL [ ]Prophylaxis and prompt management of emerging symptoms may help to minimize the impact of PPE on QoL and adherence Table a0 Prophylactic measures predominantly involve skin care practices to remove hyperkeratotic areas and to minimize friction and damage prior to the start of treatment [ ] Recommendations include use of thick cotton gloves and

in the CED After the sorption of clay crystallites and the subsequent performance of moleculardynamics of each of the configurations the CED wasdetermined using the cohesive energy density optionof the Forcite module of the software The authorshave experienced that the CED concept consisting ofthe total van der Waals and electrostatic CEDs canquite closely explain the various molecularlevel processes and interactions and simulate the extent of affinitybinding created among the simulated complexes[�] Quantitatively CED is defined as the amountof energy needed for the transition of  mol of material from the liquid to the gaseous phase It is also ameasureofaffinityattractivenessthe mutualofmolecules and is expressed both as electrostatic andvan der Waalsan NPTensembleaveraged overforcesIn the Forcite module van der Waals energies wereevaluated using atombased cutoffsIn this methodnonbond interactions are simply calculated to a cutoffdistance and interactions beyond this distance are ignored To avoid the discontinuities caused by direct cutoffs most simulations use a switching function to turnoff nonbond interactions over a range of distancessmoothly An effective potential is created by multiplyingthe actual potential by the smoothing function Thechoice of the function in the intermediate range is crucial and should be continuously differentiable in this region so that forces can be calculated In this study acubic spline smoothing function was used with a splinewidth of   and a cutoff distance of  Results and DiscussionsThe final configuration of the SARSCoV2 ShACE2complex is shown in Fig 4a while the complexes between SARSCoV2 spike and different numbers of clayNamontmorillonite crystallites are respectively shownin Fig 4b c For comparison purposes total CEDs ofvarious proportionsnumbers of the clay crystallites onthe SARSCoV2 spike and the interaction of the laterwith hACE2 are plotted in Fig Based on our experience we have hypothesized thatnanoclays due to their high adhesive properties couldalso act as SARSCoV2 inhibitors They can do it bystrongly associating with the spike S present on SARSCoV2 The results obtained from the molecularlevelsimulations of the interactions indicate that due to veryhigh CED between SARSCoV2 and the nanoclays ascompared to the former and hACE2 Fig  they couldinhibit SARSCoV2 from getting engaged with hACE2Moreover it could also be concluded from Fig  thatthe extent of inhibition due to nanoclays is increased inquantity dosagedependent wayNanoclay Interactions with SARSCoV2

while a zeta potential of less than  mV generally results in agglomeration Higher dispersion tendencies ZP of the clay nanops used in the study �� to ��  mV lead to higher dispersion tendency andhence in the generation of higher surface area amplifyingthe interactions with the SARSCoV2 spike Althoughbased on their ZP Namontmorillonite nanopshave hydrophilic nature they in the presence of saltsalso promote secondary adhesion mechanisms betweenhydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces [] It should alsobe noted that these clay nanops have high dispersion tendency due to their hydrophilic nature and relatively higher repulsive acidbase AB interactions Table High dispersion in turn results in the generation ofhigh surface area for increasing the attractive interactions Higher surface areas promote larger attractionsdue to the van der Waal attractions and the electrostaticforces among oppositely charged surfaces Besides although of relatively lesser degree positively chargededges of Namontmorillonite ps also get electrically attracted to the spike SThe results of the molecularlevel simulations for theinteraction of SARSCoV2 spike S with the clay crystallites Fig  also confirm the above interaction behaviors It has been observed that the sorption of the claynanops results in the formation of closely interacting strong van der Waals attraction fields These van derWaals

theviruses into the cell by preventing the attachment of viruses to their target receptor on the cell Antibody binding can occur at different sites on the surface proteinleading to various mechanisms that cause the same effect In the case of SARSCoV2 two viral neutralizationmechanisms by antibodies have been observed [ ]and shown in Fig 1c d One of the mechanisms involvesdirect binding of antibodies to the attachment site of theSARSCoV2RBD resulting in the antibody competingwith the target receptor hACE2 Another mechanism involves the binding of antibodies to the other sites onRBD

Recognize which are the elements that predict why a person is aging faster or slower and which interventionwe can arrange to slow down the process which permits to prevent or delay the progression of

stressors [] If any definition of aging may appear incompleteand insufficient much more difficult and complex is to findthe marker or biomarker that can identify itMany theories currently trying to explain aging processesand many biomarkers are identified to measure aging and itsevolutionary stages Theories and biomarkers are not studiedto extend life span but to guide therapeutic choices and optimize patient management and personalization of careThe purpose of this paper is not purely to list which biomarkers are able to identify the various stages of aging ratherexplain how an epiphenomenon natural and physiological isso complex [] how many factors are protagonists in its development and how many actors and characters play in maximizing its individual features taking into account social andmorbidity biomarker These factors such as frailty loss ofautonomy essential needs and comorbidities influence theaging process and are able to justify why the biological ageof a person living in a country does not correspond to the ageof another person living in a country with better sociosanitaryconditionsClinical and Biological Aging PhenotypesThe aging phenotype can be described as a complex mosaicresulting from the interaction of a variety of environmentalstochastic and genetic�epigenetic eventsstimuli impinginglifelong on our body [ ]There is no clear evidence which molecular cellular orphysiological changes are the most important drivers of theaging process andor how they influence one another [] In itsbroadest sense aging merely refers to the changes that occurduring an anisms� life span though the rate at which thesetake place varies widely [] Despite its enormous complexityinvolving combinations of these variables a small number ofbasic molecular mechanisms underpin the aging process including a set of evolutionary highly conserved basic biological mechanisms responsible for body maintenance and repairOne of the key mechanisms is inflammation a typical featureof the aging process is the development of a chronic lowgrade inflammatory status named �inflammaging� [8cid129] whichemerged as critical in the pathogenesis of major agerelatedchronic diseases such as atherosclerosis type  diabetes and neuro degeneration Inflammaging plays a pivotal role in themost important geriatric conditions such as sarc ia [9cid129cid129]osteoporosis [] frailty and disability thus contributing tomortality [] Interestingly a variety of tissues adipose tissue muscle ans brain liver systems immune systemand ecosystems gut microbiota of the body indicated as�subsystems� can contribute to the onset and progressionof such a systemic inflammatory state [] by increasing theproduction of several proinflammatory mediators or loweringthat of the antiinflammatory ones [8cid129]To differentiate the innocuous changes from those leadingto increased risk of disease disability or death biogerontologists tend to use a more precise term�senescence�when describing aging [] Senescence is thereforethe progressive deterioration of bodily functions over time andnormal human aging has been associated with a loss of complexity in a wide range of physiological processes and anatomic structures [] including blood pressure [] strideintervals [] respiratory cycles [] and vision [] amongothers such as postural dynamics [] ultimately leading todecreased fertility and increased risk or mortality []Systemic consequences of aging are widespread but theycan be clustered into four domains Fig � Changing in body composition�The balance between energy availability and energydemandSignaling networks that maintain homeostasis�� NeurodegenerationThese changes develop in parallel and affect each otherthrough many feedforward and feedback loopThe phenotype that results from the aging process is characterized by increased susceptibility to disease high risk ofmultiple coexisting diseases impaired response to stress theemergence of �geriatric syndromes� altered response to treatment high risk of disability and loss of personal autonomywith all its psychological and social consequences On theother hand all these factors influence aging itself in a dynamic and parallel way so that they can be considered as not onlya consequence of aging but also an integral part of the agingprocessTheories of AgingHuman aging is currently defined as a dynamic process involving the continual adaptation of the body to lifelong exposure tointernal and external damaging as conceptualized in the �remodelling theory of aging� [21cid129cid129] Theories of aging are generallyclassified as either program or damage theories Programmedaging theories suggest that there is a deliberate deterioration withage because a limited life span results in evolutionary benefits[] This plan could be a result of �aging genes� The firstdescribed mutation to yield a significant extension in the life spanof Caenorhabditis elegans was in the ageI gene which wasshown to result in a  increase in mean life span and a increase in maximum life span of this anism []Evolutionary biologists may argue that aging occurs due to theabsence of natural selection at the postreproductive stage of life[] Although such aging theories are subjectively appealing asthey convey a cure for aging the accumulation of damage is aspontaneous entropydriven process [] Among the damage 0cCurr Oncol Rep            Fig  Systemic consequences ofagingPage  of     theories a prevailing idea is that of oxidative damage Reactiveoxygen species ROS are generated during metabolism throughseveral interrelated reactions The supposition that aging may becaused by ROS has been further substantiated by studies involving transgenic animals for genes encoding antioxidants The lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster has been extended by overexpression of both superoxide dismutase SOD and catalase bothantioxidant enzymes [] Since mitochondria are the major producer of ROS in mammalian cells mitochondrial DNAmtDNA is therefore particularly susceptible to oxidative damage [] Mitochondrial maintenance is therefore essential topreserve cellular homeostasis and impaired mitochondrial maintenance has been described as a shared hallmark of numeroushuman pathologies and aging [] Mitochondrial DNA varieswith age and it is commonly considered that DNA hypomethylation is a typical aspect of the aging process [] ROS are activeintermediates of DNA methylation as well as histone modification These reactive oxygen species may play a role in epigeneticprocesses physiological phenotypic variations caused by external or environmental factors that switch genes onoff throughreactions of nucleophilic substitution at the DNA levelConsequently it has been suggested that better preservation ofDNA methylation levels slower cell metabolism and improvedcontrol in signal transmission through epigenetic mechanismscould be key processes involved in human longevity Oxidativedamage to proteins is irreversible and irreparable [] and mustbe degraded by the proteasome The proteasome is the mostimportant proteolytic machinery in eukaryotic cells largely responsible for the removal of oxidized proteins and the preventionof its aggregation [] However it has been shown that theactivity of proteasome is impaired during aging leading to theaccumulation of oxidizing proteins aggresome and lipofuscinsocalled the age pigment Similarly to oxidative damage nitrosamine damage�that caused by reactive nitrogen speciesRNS such as nitric oxide�has been suggested to also contribute to agerelated diseases namely hepatic steatosis and apoptosis [] as well as functional and structural changes in the cardiovascular system [ ] sleep homeostasis [] psychological disorders [] and dementia []Most supporters of the genomic instability theory of agingrefer to telomere shortening [] and mutation in DNA mitochondrial Telomeres are the repeated DNA sequences at theends of linear chromosomes which are unable to be fullyreplicated by DNA polymerasesMutations in mtDNA cause a wide range of human mitochondrial diseases and have been implicated in agerelateddiseases and agingBiomarker FeaturesFinding the biomarker of aging is one of the most importantgoals of medicine The National Institutes of HealthBiomarkers Definitions Working Group defined a biomarkeras �a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluatedas an indicator of normal biological processes pathogenicprocesses or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic

humanssince preliminary testing is always done in nonhumansubjectsFerrucci et al reviewed the biomarkers proposed as elements of a theory based on the balance between �resiliencemechanisms� and �accumulated damages� where biomarkersact in reducing resilience mechanisms or increasing damages[40cid129] Tables  and The pathways eligible to become biomarkers are thefollowingGenomic Instability Endogenous and exogenous agents continuously challenge the integrity of DNA when DNA repairmechanisms cannot manage the repeated damage the result isan accumulation of DNA somatic mutations This phenomenon causes dysregulation of gene expression and the production of altered proteins that lead to cellular damage Somaticmutation accumulation has been observed in skeletal musclecells neurons

determines the phenotypic characteristics of the different cells and tissues The main mechanismsare DNA methylation histone modification and noncodingRNA While DNA methylation is easily measured in

to apoptosis[] This process is called cellular senescence and is characterized by structural and functional changes in the cell []Senescent cells produce proinflammatory cytokines andchemokines growth factors and matrix proteases called �senescenceassociated secretory phenotype� SASP [ ]which may induce some agerelated diseases [�] Thedetection of SASP has been proposed as a biomarker of aging[]Deregulated NutrientSensing Genetic mutations in growthhormone and the insulinlike growth factor have been linkedto longevity [] Moreover dietary restriction showed to increase life span in primates [ ] For these reasons thispathway has been proposed as biomarkers of agingSteam Cell Exhaustion The decline in the regenerative potential is one of the elements at the base of aging [] Despitepharmacological interventions being explored to counteractthis phenomenon [] evidences are still poor 0c    Page  of Curr Oncol Rep            Altered Intercellular Communication With aging we also observe changes in intercellular communication as inflammatory reaction increases the other communication ways becomedysfunctional endocrine neuronal immune system []As we discussed earlier inflammation can be inappropriately increased in aging and this has been related to agerelated disease [ ]Indeed the pathways described as potential biomarkers ofaging are strongly related to inflammation for this reasonmeasuring circulating levels of cytokines is considered anew field of research [ 84cid129 ]Aging and Life ExpectancyAging and life expectancy are closely related In a broadsense determining an individual�s life expectancy is also away of schematizing his or her aging process Life expectancyis a statistical measure of the average time an anism isexpected to live based on the year of its birth LEB itscurrent age and demographic factors including gender []In the last decades life expectancy has increased in high income country the rise in human life expectancy has involveddeclines in intrinsic and extrinsic mortality processes associated respectively with senescence and environmental challenges []In association to this increased longevity there are diseasescalled agerelated that increase quadratically with age andcause a progressive loss of physical mental and cognitiveintegrities leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to morbidity mortality [] and disability in additionto increasing care needs and agerelated burden measuredthrough the sum of disabilityadjusted life years DALYs ofthese diseases among these adults Fig  Ninetytwo of the of the Global Burden of Disease causes were identified asagerelated diseases In particular cardiovascular diseaseneoplasm and chronic respiratory disorders are those withhigher agerelated disease burden []Determinants of Frailty Syndrome as AgingBiomarkerFrailty can be defined as a state of increased vulnerabilityto stressors or a loss of capacity to resolve homeostasisperturbation Frailty condition is closely related to aging[88cid129cid129] and the frailty indexes can consequently be considered biomarkers of aging themselves In frail individuals it is possible to find both changing in body composition and balance between energy availability and energydemand Moreover in the definition of frailty it is welldescribed how signaling networks maintain homeostasisand association with neurodegeneration These fouraspects all refer to the hallmarks of aging Frailty is associated with adverse clinical outcomes including falls institutionalization and death [88cid129cid129]Two principal models emerged in the last decades that areable to conceptualize and consequently measure frailty in everyday clinical practice and research the �frailty phenotype�model and the cumulative deficits modelThe frailty phenotype was first described by Fried and colleagues in  analyzing data from the CardiovascularHealth Study CHS involving  men and women aged years and older In this study it was investigated whichcharacteristics of the population were predictive of falls disability hospitalization and death Their operational definitionof frailty included a cluster of at least three of the followingvariables unintentional weight loss selfreported exhaustionlow energy expenditure slow gait speed and weak gripstrength This model does not take into consideration cognitive impairment as a cause of increased vulnerability as thiscould contribute to functional decline and adverse events inolder people [ ]The cumulative deficits model was developed byRockwood and colleagues as part of the prospectiveCanadian Study of Health and Aging CSHA involvinga cohort of  older adults [] The authors identified  parameters including diseases disabilities signssymptoms and laboratory values which were defined as�deficits� The sum of the deficits in a single individualallowed for the calculation of a frailty index ie thenumber of deficits divided by  Frailty in this modelis not considered as a cluster of symptoms but is conceptualized as a gradable syndrome with a higher number ofdeficits implying an increased vulnerability state The twomodels of frailty show significant overlap although theycapture slightly different sides of the same problem It isimportant to notice that physical frailty is frequently associated with multimorbidity [ 93cid129 ]It has been observed that the frailty phenotype construct is intrinsically related to mobility issues Indeedin older adults physical performance measures are a robust and consistent predictor for disability hospitalization institutionalization and death both in the researchand in the clinical setting Lower physical performance isfrequently associated with loss of skeletal muscle massand quality causing reduced strength and functional impairment [95cid129cid129] This process has been called sarc iaEven though sarc ia has been long associated withaging it has to be acknowledged that it can develop muchearlier in life [] Different definitions exist for this condition for the operational definition of sarc ia both inthe clinic and for research purposes that prioritize theassessment of muscle strength over muscle mass to identity sarc ic patients Strength is more closely related tosurvival and functional decline compared with muscle 0cCurr Oncol Rep

total health care expenditures This  is represented by older people individuals with multiple chronic conditions many medications frequent hospitalizations and limitations on their ability to perform basic daily functions due tophysical mental or psychosocial challenge []Since the health care and social needs of older adults differfrom that of other adults it is necessary to identify the needs ofthe elderly to make proper plans that will promote their healthCurrently most of the conducted studies had mainly focused on the elderly physical health needs and had neglectedto take into account other needs such as social and health careneeds Furthermore in addition to quantitative studies discovering the older adults� �perceptions� of their own health needsis also necessaryConclusionThere is a large interest of researchers in biomarkers of agingand despite some of them seem to be very promising biological biomarkers are still far from a clinical application to datethere is no technique that meets the mentioned criteria of theideal biomarker [40cid129] Moreover we know that the biologicalpathways are the final agents of aging but on one side theycan be influenced by social economic

there is no single biomarker to date that has beenfound able to identify the stage of this process At thesame time clinical clusters have been added to purelybiological markers and social ones should

mouse salivary tissues []Cell Detection MethodsThe following methods have been used for detecting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cells of human and animal tissue RNAseq N   IHC N   RTPCR N   in a0situ hybridization ISH N   and WB N   Different detection approaches were used in  studies [ ] One study reported specific genetic analysis [] There were significant differences between studies regarding methods used While Ziegler et a0al and Sungnak et a0al detected ACE2 by RNAseq in goblet cells Lee et a0al did not find any immunohistochemical labeling [  ] However the results reported in sustentacular cells agree in the same direction whatever the technique used whether by RNAseq or by ISH and immunocytochemistry [�] The discrepancies are rather observed between studies having performed immunohistochemistry Indeed using two different antibodies Hikmet did not find ACE2 expression in nasopharynx epithelium whereas others demonstrated the staining of the apical surface of epithelia and ciliated epithelial cells [  ] Interestingly all the studies which carried out RNAseq found an expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 at the epithelial level which implies that the technique used could generate biases between the studies [ � �] 0cHead and Neck Pathology DiscussionThe presentation of COVID19 infection may be in several clinical forms ranging from anosmia in isolation to severe multiple an failure and death The mechanisms underlying the COVID19 polymorphism are still unknown To infect tissues SARSCoV2 needs to entry into the cells which is allowed through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors [] The identification of virus receptor expression in the tissues makes particularly sense to better understand the clinical expression of the disease This systematic review sheds light on many pointsFirst ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors are expressed in epithelial and nonepithelial cells throughout the head and neck The head and neck expression may support the otolaryngological clinical picture of the disease which was recently found in European and North American COVID patients [   ] By entering the body via the epithelial cells of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa the SARSCoV2 virus leads to an inflammatory reaction and the development of otolaryngological symptoms Nasal entrance of the virus through high ACE2 expression was supported in the study of Wu et a0al who found a higher virus concentration in nasal swabs compared with throat swabs []The olfactory cleft is a nasal region that has drawn the attention of many researchers over the past few weeks Indeed recent data supported that more than  of COVID19 patients developed subjective olfactory dysfunction especially when patients suffered from mildtomoderate forms of the disease [   ] Because ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in the nasal mucosa of the olfactory cleft entrance into the olfactory bulb seems plausible Once in the bulb according to some human studies [ ] the virus could infect cells that express ACE2 or TMPRSS2 namely glial and neuronal stem cells Fig a0Integrating the molecular clinical and radiological characteristics of SARSCOV2 olfactory loss may shed light about its pathophysiological process Taking into account that the loss is often temporary SARSCOV2 may primarily infect the sustentacular cells supporting the olfactory sensory neurons This infection may cause rapid disruption of the olfactory epithelium structure and function with a possible inflammatory response inducing sudden onset smell loss This inflammation is observed in a minority of patient with congested olfactory cleft who underwent CT scan [   �]ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also found in horizontal basal olfactory stem cells located in the basal layer They are less exposed to the external environment thus less likely to be infected in first line the loss would have been more Fig    Epithelium of Olfactory Cleft The figure summarizes the olfactory cleft epithelium 0c Head and Neck Pathologyprogressive However once infected they might slow down recovery time because horizontal basal cells give rise to many cell type in the olfactory epithelium They may also contribute to virus spread to the olfactory bulb vascular pericytes Magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies of the olfactory bulb [ ] in which ACE2 are only expressed in vascular pericytes but not in neurons may show inflammatory signs suggesting that the infection process can extend more centrally and promote inflammatory response [] Inflammatory causes are often quickly reversible for example after a oneweek trial of high dose of corticosteroids or simply days after the resolution of the viral infection suggesting that the olfactory neurons and bulbs are still somewhat intact This seems to be the case for a majority of patients In contrast with more sustained destruction of neuronal olfactory structures the recovery time is much longer and may take � a0years given the slow neuroregeneration process [ ]In this systematic review we found that three studies reported high ACE2 expression in major or minor salivary gland human tissues [  ] These data corroborate the literature findings that reported a salivary pattern of SARSCoV2 and related parotitis [ ] Moreover the virus spread into the salivary gland tissues allows us a better understanding the mechanisms underlying salivary transmission Interestingly in  Liu et a0al observed that monkeys infected by SARSCoV had a salivary viral spread which was associated with a salivary virion excretion [] These data support the need to conduct future studies investigating the presence of SARSCoV2 in the saliva of infected human and to corroborate the saliva findings with the ACE2 salivary gland expressionThe head and neck expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and the related otolaryngological symptom pattern seems obvious but could vary across individuals and populations In support of this Lee et a0al observed that ACE2 expression is influenced by patient demographics clinical characteristics comorbidities and medication [] As reported in the genetic analysis of Cao et a0al there would be different susceptibilities or responses to SARSCoV2 in different populations [] The polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression could explain the clinical differences between individuals Indeed many physicians reported in clinical and epidemiological studies different clinical presentation of the disease [ ] which could be associated with virus mutations [  ] The virus mutations and the related impact on receptor binding and infectivity is another point that has to be considered in future studies Otherwise according to the Bgee database https bgee expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 evaluated in murine models may increase with age These findings have to be confirmed in humans but could explain more severe clinical pictures in the elderlyThe present study has several limitations First the heterogeneity between studies about the detection method may lead to detection bias as some approaches are more sensitive than others Some studies interrogate gene expression at mRNA level and others at protein levels both types of analysis having their advantages and limitations Compared to transcriptomic analyzes immunohistochemistry brings additional important spatial information in tissue samples but recently Sorokin et a0al demonstrated high and statistically significant correlations between the RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical measurements [] Interestingly they highlighted the complementarity of both techniques for measuring cancer biomarkers in FFPE samples However differences observed across IHC studies suggest the involvement of many parameters The antibody specificity is a big challenge to ensure reproducibility of antibodybased studies and given the high homology between ACE1 and ACE2 cautions must be taken regarding antibody selection Besides a report from the International Working Group for Antibody Validation IWGAV proposed five scientific approaches to validate antibody specificity [] then such strategies must be considered in future investigations to confirm the published observations In addition it seems essential to enlarge and diversify patient cohorts and to combine transcriptomic and proteomic strategies as well as colocalize different markers of SARSCoV2 such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to provide an accurate representation of ACE2 expression through all head and neck areas of the whole populationSecond the majority of studies that were conducted during the SARSCoV2 pandemic did not consider many demographic and clinical factors such as the age of patients from who the tissues were extracted or the use of ACE inhibitor medications among others Third some otolaryngological regions remain uninvestigated such as the vocal folds The investigation of these remaining regions may shed further light on some recently reported unusual clinical phenomena such as severe dysphonia []ConclusionACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in head and neck tissues which may explain the otolaryngological clinical pattern of the disease and the entry of SARSCoV2 into the host anism Future studies considering demographical and clinical characteristics of patients from who the tissues are extracted are needed to better understand the cell entry mechanisms of SARSCoV2Author contributions

normal tissues Theselenium concentrations in synovial ﬂuid and plasma of OA patients were not significantly different from thoseof  healthy controls106 Similarly no significant difference in selenium concentration was noted between sixdogs with posttraumatic OA and six control dogs107Second the beneﬁcial effect of selenium supplementationin alleviating OA symptoms has been debated The resultsfrom a controlled doubleblind trial of  patientsOfﬁcial journal of the Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biologyrevealed that the supplementation of a formulation containing selenium with vitamins A C and E SeACE didnot have any remarkable curative effect compared to aplacebo108 In a study with an independent cohort theprevalence of radiographic knee OA was not significantlyassociated

pigmentation  []  The  first  worldwide  survey  of  copy  number  variation  in  goats  was  performed  within  the  Goat ADAPTmap Project httpwwwgoata daptm ap and involved the genomewide genotyping of  goats from  breeds [] This study resulted in the identification of  CNVR among which several overlapped with genes that  are  functionally  related  with  local  adaptation  such as coat color muscle development metabolic processes and embryonic development [] Moreover the patterns of the diversity of CNV differed according to geographic origin  which  indicates  that  they  have  been  influenced by population history [] In another study on  individuals from  East African goat breeds Nandolo et a0al [] detected  CNVR More recently Henkel et a0al [] demonstrated the existence of complex patterns of structural variation in the regions containing the caprine ASIP and KIT genes with potential causal effects on pigmentation In spite of these efforts the description of structural chromosomal  variation  in  goats  is  still  lagging  behind that of other domestic species Most of the CNV surveys in goats have analyzed large populations that represent a mixture of different breeds each with a limited number of individuals [ ] thus making it difficult to assess the magnitude of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level Our goal was to fill this gap by analyzing a population of  individuals from a single Spanish breed MurcianoGranadina  and  to  investigate  the  functional  roles  of genes that map to CNVR and compare these results with data obtained in

correlation structure of the LRR values of the SNPs  mapping  to  CNVR  []  Then  we  reassigned  the CNV  calls  that  were  initially  obtained  with  PennCNV and QuantiSNP to each refined CNVR so that the final set  of  CNVR  comprised  only  those  that  were  simultaneously  detected  by  both  callers  The  resulting  CNVR were matched to gene features that are annotated in the National

BeadChip analysis 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of DiscussionIn this work our aim was to characterize copy number variation  in  MurcianoGranadina  goats  a  native  Spanish breed used for milk production By genotyping  MurcianoGranadina  goats  with  a  SNP  array  we  were able  to  identify    CNVR  covering    of  the  goat genome  whereas  Liu  et a0 al  []  identified  CNVR  that covered   of the goat genome The latter higher percentage reported by Liu et a0al [] can be explained by the fact that they analyzed  breeds with different geographical  origins  ie  a  composite  population  that  is probably much more diverse than that used in our work Besides  the  pipeline  that  we  used  to  identify  CNVR is more stringent than that employed by Liu et a0al [] removing CNVR that were not consistently detected by PennCNV and QuantiSNP In the literature estimates of  to  for CNVR coverage in the human genome are reported [] Our results and those obtained by Liu et a0al [] are consistent with these valuesIndeed  when  Liu  et a0 al  []  calculated  the  CNVR length  for  each  breed  normalized  by  the  goat  genome size their results agreed well with our estimate of  For  instance  this  parameter  reached  values  of   in  goats  from  Southeastern  Africa  and    in  goats from  Northwestern  Africa  and  Eastern  Mediterranean whereas it was lowest  for individuals from West Asia  []  The  number  of  CNV  detected  at  the  withinbreed  level  by  Liu  et a0 al  []  was  on  average    CNV per breed and ranged from  to  whereas the average number of CNVR was only   per breed [] Since the number of detected CNVR is proportional to population size for most of the breeds investigated in [] the level of withinbreed CNV variation is probably underestimated In summary one important conclusion from our study is that the magnitude of CNV diversity at the withinbreed  level  is  likely  to  be  much  larger  than  that previously  reported  in  studies  that  analyzed  multiple populations  each  represented  by  a  small  or  moderate number of individualsMost of the CNVR that we report here ranged in size from  to a0kb with a mean size of a0kb Similarly the average CNVR size reported by Liu et a0al [] was a0kb Both estimates are quite large and reflect that mediumdensity SNP arrays are not well suited to detect small CNVR in spite of their high abundance In cattle the  average  sizes  of  CNVR  detected  with  the  Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip a0K SNPs [] Illumina wholegenome sequencing and PacBio sequencing []  were      and  a0 kb  respectively  Another consistent feature of CNVR is that in general their frequencies are low or very low In our study approximately   of  the  CNVR  had  frequencies  lower  than    and the average frequency was  Liu et a0al [] reported lower  CNVR  frequencies  ranging  from    Alpine and  Northern  European  goats  to    Northwestern African goats This decreased average CNVR frequency is  not  very  significant  and  probably  reflects  differences in  sampling  size  and  the  use  of  composite  populations with  multiple  breeds  each  one  with  its  specific  CNVR frequenciesThe CNVR detected in our study covered  proteincoding  genes  Pathway  analyses  reflected  a  substantial enrichment  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  olfactory  perception  which  is  consistent  with  previous  reports  in cattle [ ] In this regard there is an important difference between our results and those by Liu et a0al [] Whereas in the study of Liu et a0al [] the term �sensory perception� was underrepresented among the CNV genes fold enrichment   in our work the terms �olfactory transduction�  fold  enrichment    and  �Gprotein coupled  purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity�  fold enrichment    were  overrepresented  and  many CNV  genes  were  olfactory  receptors  The  two  terms mentioned  before  are  closely  related  because  a  broad array of purinergic receptors are differentially expressed in  the  olfactory  receptor  neurons  that  modulate  odor responsiveness  []  Moreover  purinergic  nucleotides are  important  neuromodulators  of  peripheral  auditory and visual sensory systems [] In cattle Keel et a0al [] reported that �sensory perception of smell� and �Gprotein  coupled  receptor  signaling  pathway�  were  significantly overrepresented in the proteincoding genes that overlapped  with  CNVR  Similarly  Upadhyay  et a0 al  [] showed that �sensory perceptions of smell� and �chemical  stimuli�  are  enriched  in  their  set  of  CNV  genes  A potential  explanation  for  the  underrepresentation  of the �sensory perception� functional category among the genes overlapping CNV reported by Liu et a0al [] could be that in goats these genes are not well annotated yet so the majority of them are identified with a LOC prefix and a number and as a consequence of this they are not  correctly  detected  by  PANTHER  []  thus  biasing the  results  obtained  in  the  gene  ontology  enrichment analysisLoci  belonging  to  large  multigene  families  might  be more  prone  to  colocalize  with  CNV  because  paralogous  genes  can  act  as  templates  in  nonallelic  homologous  recombination  events  which  promote  increases or  reductions  in  copy  number  []  It  should  be  noted that olfactory receptor genes constitute the largest gene superfamily  and  in  humans  more  than    genes  and pseudogenes  have  been  identified  []  In  cattle   olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes are distributed in    clusters  across    bovine  chromosomes  []  and similar numbers have been reported for pigs [] Moreover  purifying  selection  against  CNV  is  probably  less  0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of intense in regions that contain olfactoryreceptor genes than in genomic regions that contain genes with essential functions [] Interestingly copy number changes in the olfactory receptor genes of wild and domestic mammals might have consequences on food foraging as well as on mate and predator recognition [ ]In the set of genes that colocalize with CNVR we also detected  an  enrichment  of  loci  related  with  the  multigene  family  of  ATP  binding  cassette  ABC  transporters  a  result  that  agrees  well  with  previous  findings  in humans  [�]  and  cattle  [  ]  In  mammals  ABC transporters fulfill the mission of carrying a broad array of endogenous substrates such as amino acids peptides sugars anions and hydrophobic compounds and metabolites  across  lipid  membranes  At  least    ABC  genes that belong to eight subfamilies have been identified in the human genome [] Copy number variation in the human ABCC4 and ABCC6 genes is associated with susceptibility  to  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  [] and to the rare autosomal recessive disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum [] respectively Moreover largescale deletions of the human ABCA1 gene are a causative factor  for  hypoalphalipoproteinemia  []  a  disease  that  is characterized by the complete absence of the apolipoprotein AI and extremely low levels of plasma highdensity lipoprotein  HDL  cholesterol  We  also  found  a  highly significant enrichment of pathways related with embryo development  anteriorposterior  pattern  specification embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis as previously reported [] These pathways are featured by genes that belong to the Hox multigene family of transcription factors possibly reflecting the genomic instability of certain homeobox gene clusters as evidenced by the existence of many syntenyparalogy breakpoints and assembly gaps as outlined in comparative studies []Although  not  significant  after  correction  for  multiple testing  we  detected  an  enrichment  of  pathways  with metabolic  significance  such  as  prolactin  and  insulin signaling which could have an impact on milk production  and  growth  [�]  Interestingly  the  comparison of our work with that of Liu et a0al [] revealed  proteincoding genes that colocalize with the set of shared CNVR One of the most relevant shared genes encodes ASIP a protein that increases the ratio of pheomelanin to  eumelanin  by  binding  to  the  melanocortin    receptor  and  delivering  an  antagonist  signal  that  blocks  the downstream expression of eumelanogenic enzymes [] Mutations in the ASIP gene play critical roles in animal pigmentation [] For instance the causal factor of the white color typical of many sheep breeds is the ubiquitous expression of a duplicated copy of the ASIP coding sequence  which  is  regulated  by  a  duplicated  promoter corresponding  to  the  itchy  E3  ubiquitin  protein  ligase gene  [  ]  Although  some  studies  proposed  that  the ASIP CNV might be associated with different pigmentation patterns in goats [  ] no functional assay has verified an association of ASIP copy number with ASIP mRNA  levels  Another  interesting  shared  copy  number variable gene is ADAMTS20 which was also identified in two previous CNV surveys [ ] This gene encodes a metalloproteinase with an important role in melanoblast survival by mediating Kit signaling [] and in palatogenesis [] Bertolini et a0al [] performed a selection scan in white vs colored black and red goats and detected a selective sweep in the ADAMTS20 gene In the light of these  results  the  potential  involvement  of  a  structural variation  in  ADAMTS20  in  goat  pigmentation  should be explored further Moreover it is worthwhile to mention that several CNVR genes have functions related with production  and  reproduction  traits  For  instance  the NCKAP5 gene which colocalizes with CNVR_160_chr2 frequency   is associated with milk fat percentage in  cattle  []  Taking  the  above  evidence  into  account the implication of structural chromosomal variations in the  genetic  determinism  of  traits  of  economic  interest with a complex inheritance deserves further exploration by designing tools that allow inferring CNVR genotypes with high confidenceConclusionsWith  the  PennCNV  and  QuantiSNP  software  we detected    CNVR  in  the  genome  of  the  MurcianoGranadina  breed  In  a a0 previous  study  []  that  used  a less  stringent  pipeline  only  PennCNV  was  used  and included  multiple  populations  with  small  to  moderate  sample  sizes  the  average  number  of  CNVR  events per breed was   One conclusion of our study is that CNV surveys which are based on a broad array of breeds represented  by  only  a  few  individuals  underestimate the true levels of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level The main reason for this outcome is that since the majority of CNV have very low frequencies they cannot be detected efficiently when sample size is small and in consequence  much  of  the  existing  variation  is  missed We have also found that genes that overlap with CNV are functionally related with olfactory transduction embryo development  ABC  transporters  and  Gprotein  coupled purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity  Most  of  these genes  belong  to  large  multigene  families  encompassing tens  hundreds  or  thousands  of  paralogous  genes  that could act as substrates in nonallelic homologous recombination  events  which  is  one  of  the  main  mechanisms generating  duplications  and  deletions  in  humans  and other  species  Finally  we  detected  CNV  that  colocalize with the ASIP and ADAMTS20 pigmentation genes 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol

T2DM [] The risk of developing T2DM is strongly associated withmany predispositions behavioral and environmental risk factors and also genetic factors [�] Besides the genetic factors strong evidence indicates that factors such asobesity and physical inactivity are the main nongenetic determinants of the disease [] T2DM can range from predominant insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to dominant defective secretion with insulin resistance [] It is often related tometabolic syndrome problems Individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance arehighrisk subjects of type  diabetes

importance of early detection of T2DM machine learning and Data Mining techniquesare tools that can improve the analysis and interpretation or extraction of knowledgefrom the data [ ] These techniques may enhance the prognosis and diagnosis associated with life quality reducing diseases such as T2DM [ ]To date several other studies tried to predict diabetes mellitus using outstandingdata mining

appliedfour classification models including classification algorithms like Knearest neighbor KNN support vector machine SVM logistic regression and artificial neuralnetworks ANN for diagnosing T2DM and we compared the diagnostic power ofthese algorithms with each other In the present study we aimed to find the bestdata mining approach for the prediction of T2DM using six lncRNA expressionThe result of this study could improve our knowledge about the early detectionand diagnosis of T2DM using the lncRNAs as biomarkers []MethodsThe primary aim of the present study was to implement four models to predict DT2Mapplying data mining techniques based on the lncRNA variables The research objectives of our study wereImplementing data mining techniques for prediction of the DT2M Comparing the applied methodsselecting the best model for the T2DM prediction 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of We used the variables for predicting T2DM and comparing the performance of thevarious data mining techniques For the implementation of the algorithms we usedANACONDA3�  bit a free and  source platform distribution of pythonprogramming language with a vast number of modules packages and rich libraries thatprovide various methods for classification problems For obtaining the best amount ofperformance in the models 10fold crossvalidation performed on the dataset In dealing with the small data sets crossvalidation is a prominent strategy for estimating theperformance CrossValidation is a performance evaluation technique commonly usedin practice Here the data set is repeatedly partitioned into two nonoverlapping partsa training set and a holdout set For each partitioning the holdout set is used fortesting while the remainder is used for training The two most popular variants aretenfold crossvalidation 10fold CV where the data is split into ten mutually disjointfolds []Since our samples were more than  and to be sure that each fold contains thesame proportion of healthy and diabetic individuals we used the stratified 10foldcrossvalidation approach [] Therefore the results are reliable and more credibleWe applied four popular data mining approaches on the lncRNA variables regression knearest neighbors SVM and neural network classification algorithmsKNN algorithmThe knearest neighbor�s algorithm kNN is an algorithm for classifying variables regarding the closest training data in the feature space KNN uses an instancebasedlearning method which is one of the simplest algorithms among data mining techniques This method considers the nearest neighbors to each object and decides todedicate the object to classes [ ]SVM algorithmSupport Vector Machine SVM is a supervised algorithm which divides the featurespace called hyperplanes considering the target classes SVM computes classification bymaximizing the margin of the hyperplane that intercepts classes This algorithm plots amultidimensional hyperplane that divides classes and increases the margin betweenclasses to enhance the accuracy of classification We used different kernel functionsembedded in the SVM class of SVC library in python framework as a quadratic polynomial radial basis etc to classify the instance and to detect the best accuracy amongthem [�]Artificial neural networkArtificial Neural Network is a data processing algorithm that simulates the biologicalneural network in its computations A common problem in using ANN is that they actfundamentally as a black box and the parameters are set by the model so we cannotdemonstrate them [] we can just apply the model in our problems and obtain thehigh performance We used Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN Thestructure of a multilayer perceptron neural network has been demonstrated in Fig It maps a set of input data into a set of appropriate output classes It includes threelayers input layer hidden layer  output layer The principal function of neurons of the 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of Fig  Artificial Neural Network structureinput layer is to divide input Xi into neurons in the hidden layer The neuron of thehidden layer adds the appropriate weights of Wij to the input variables The output formula isYj � fWji XiX 10 11Where f is a simple threshold function that we considered sigmoid and hyperbolictangent function []In the present study a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN was performed The structure of MLPNN is as shown in Fig  It makes a map of input dataonto a set of suitable output dataThe RBF networks are another type of neural network In MLP each neuron considers the weighted sum of its input values in which each input value is multiplied by acoefficient and the results are the sum of values RBF is a more intuitive approach toMLP An RBFN classifies the inputs by calculating the input�s similarity to examplesfrom the training set Each RBFN neuron stores one of the examples from the trainingset as a �prototype� for classification of new input in each neuron the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype is calculated The input is dedicated to aclass when it has more similar to that class than the other classesLogistic regressionLogistic regression is a common approach for predictive modeling practices The functionpX provides probability output between  and  for all values of X where X1�Xp are

research conducted bySaeidi  and Mansoori  [ ] and the research of Parvizi and colleagues which 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of is not published yet We integrated these three studies and our data mining analysiswas implemented in their studies The data were collected from  unrelated Iraniansubjects  T2DM patients and  healthy individuals matched for age and sexT2DM patients were recruited from individuals who referred to the Diabetic Clinic atShohada Hospital Tehran Iran In the current study we applied six lncRNAs expression and also six demographic variables including sex age weight height BMI andFBS for analysis and inputs of algorithms For the preprocessing phase we normalizedthe data inputs for KNN SVM and ANN models We also had low missing variablesand we replaced them with zero Table lncRNA extraction and selectionIncreasing evidence has suggested several lncRNAs are implicated in T2DM pathogenesis Recently human βcell transcriptome analysis showed lncRNAs dynamic regulation and abnormal expression of lncRNAs in T2DM [] However the extent oflncRNA deregulation in T2DM has yet to be determined To date more than100 susceptibility loci have been identified as being associated with T2DM at a genomewidesignificant level [ ] Considering this into account and by querying the GWAS catalog we candidated  lncRNAs LY86AS1 HCG27_201 LINC00523 LINC00994TPT1AS1and DKFZP as target genes for this studyThe large scale GWAS have recognized approximately  SNPs that were susceptibleto T2DM [] From there we used the GWAS catalog access in June  to create alist of SNPs associated with T2DM In the current study we selected six lncRNA forexpression analysis according to the scan carried out in the study of Mansoori  []and Saeedi  [] We selected variants that had associations with increased risk ofT2DM We applied a quantitative PCR analysis of lncRNA expression levels in the samples We calculated the respective amount of each lncRNAs

plot is called the ideal point It means that a larger areaunder the curve AUC is usually better According to the demonstrated ROCs theKNN and SVM have a better area under the curve in comparison with the othersDiscussionFor a medical diagnosis optimized approaches to gain useful and accurate outcomesare essential Applying machine learning and data mining methods to automate theprocess of diagnosis may assist practitioners to enhance the quality of their clinical decisions [ ]Since T2DM is one of the prevalent diseases with severe consequences [] developing efficient methods for early detection of the disease was the primary purpose of ourresearchRegardless of high number of lncRNAs in the RNA profile of human a few numbersof them has been proved to be biologically active The role of the few lncRNAs hasbeen identified but several studies discussed the significant impact of lncRNAs in diabetic people which may represent the role of abnormal expression of lncRNAs in thelncRNAs in

effective biomarkers for data mining algorithms and have afeasible power to be applied for prediction of T2DM Also in this research we optimized the parameters of every algorithm and used stratified 10fold crossvalidation togain the best performance To be mentioned in the nearest neighbor�s algorithm theparameter k was varied between one and nine to find the bestoptimized method andwe selected k   to have the best performance and the lowest standard deviation in theaccuracy of the folds In addition in choosing the parameters of the artificial neuralnetwork the number of hidden layer neurons

and combiningthem to get the best detection power of T2DM and performing four outstanding datamining algorithms and comparing their performances As the limitations of this studywe should account for the limited number of samples which is due to the high costs ofmeasuring the Long noncoding RNAs No doubt the higher number of samples wouldlead to higher performance and more reliable

T2DMThe classification techniques compared were support vector machine artificial neuralnetwork decision tree nearest neighbors and logistic regression In data mining it isnot possible to say one

cancer CRC is one of the leading cause ofdeath worldwide More than  million patients are diagnosed with CRC every year [�] What�s more this lifethreaten disease kills nearly  million people annually []In north America and Europe the morbidity and mortalityremain at high level [] despite developments of cancerscreening and endoscopy [ ] In China CRC becomesthe 5th most diagnosed cancer and 5th most deadly cancer[�] Nearly  million new cases are diagnosed andabout  million people die from the disease every year []Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is firstline treatment for CRC patients [ ] Capecitabine a carbamatederivative of fluoropyrimidine is the backbone of CRCchemotherapy [ ] Asthe oral prodrug of fluorouracil 5FU it is widely used for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy due to its long stable durationlower toxicity and convenient dosing compared to infusional 5FU [ ] However this chemotherapeutic drughas only modest efficacy the response rates of 5FU foradvanced CRC is only  for single treatment and for combined chemotherapy [ ] The chemoresistance is recognized as a principal obstacle for cancer therapy [�] leading to tumor recurrence or metastasisespecially liver and lung metastasis and cause over  ofCRC mortality [] Intense researches on the mechanisms underlying the resistance revealed that changes oftumor cells themselves cause resistance although thesefindings are mainly restricted to tumor specimen examinewhich is not that suitable for posttreatment surveillanceWhat�s more CT computed tomography scan and colonoscopy are insensitive to micro metastasis despite theirgoodrecurrenceCapecitabineresistant patients could only be diagnosedwith cancer recurrence by CT scan or colonoscopy about� years after capecitabine therapy [] when tumorsare big enough to be discovered Thus good prognosticmarkers are indispensable for predicting capecitabineresistance in the early stage after capecitabine therapydetection ofaccuracytheforCancer cells and their microenvironment could interactwith each other Immune cells could dynamically reflectcancer status and display multifaceted functions in cancerdevelopment [�] Myeloid cells including monocytesmacrophages granulocytes neutrophils eosinophils basophils and mast cells play critical roles in cancer progression [�] Myeloidderived suppressor cells MDSCs aheterogeneous population of myeloid cells remain at different stages of differentiation are immature counterparts ofmyeloid cells in cancer MDSCs acquire immunosuppressive features and mainly inhibit lymphocytes including Tcells and NK cells [�] Recent studies report that chemotherapeutic agents like 5FU could interact with myeloid cells and influence antitumor efficacy [�]Vincent J  reported that 5FU selectively inducedMDSC apoptotic cell death and increase IFN� productionby tumorspecific CD8T cells [] Other researchersshowed that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and increased amount of HSP70 exosomes on MDSC by 5FUlead to MDSC activation [ ] Yuan Y  found thattumorassociated macrophages secret IL6 to induce 5FUchemoresistance []ImportantlyIn this study we discovered that the expression ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells was dramatically decreased in capecitabineresistant CRC patients after capecitabine adjuvanttherapy The expression level ofCD16 was closely related to poor prognosis after capecitabine therapythe downregulation ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells appeared as early as month after capecitabine therapy in patients who werediagnosed with capecitabineresistance by CT scansabout � years after the treatment The cutoff value ofCD16 expression  would be helpful for the prediction of capecitabine chemoresistance Further analysisdemonstrated that these CD11bCD16low��myeloid cellswere mainly immature

healthCapecitabine the oral form of 5FU which is widelyused in CRC therapy has only modest efficacy due tothe chemoresistance Great efforts have been taken tofind out the mechanism Previous studies mainly concentrated on tumor cells themselves such as expressionof specific genes or generation of particular tumor cells[ ] In this research we worked on the correlationbetween changes on immune system and capecitabinechemoresistance and illustrated the conversion fromneutrophilsto immunosuppressive PMNMDSClikeneutrophils in these capecitabine insensitive patients byRNA sequencing and flow cytometry Our conclusioncould also be supported by other studies that 5FUcould promote MDSC protumor function The study byBruchard M  found that 5FU could activate NLRP3inflammasome in MDSC and promote tumor growth[] Gobbo J  also discovered that 5FU facilitatedproduction of tumorderived HSP70 exosomes whichfavored MDSC activation [] Thus prevention ofMDSC function after capecitabine or 5FU therapyholds great promise for improving drug efficacyreceptorResearchers have revealed that CD16myeloid cellswere tightly related to CRC development[ ]Giulio S  found that CD16myeloid cell infiltration in CRC tumor tissue represented favorable prognosis [] and by using in vitro studies these studiesalso demonstrated that colon cancer infiltrate neutrophils enhance the responsiveness of CD8 T cells byTcelltriggering [] Our work differedfrom theirs in some ways Firstly our study focusedon CRC patients who received capecitabine adjuvanttreatment after surgery while Giulio Spagnoli groupfocused on all CRC patients and some healthy donorsSecondly biopsies from different positions were analyzed Peripheral blood was used in our study whileGiulio Spagnoli group mainly focused on tumor biopsies Exceptthese differences some of our resultswere also consistent with studies from Giulio Spagnoligroup Firstly both our data and Giulio Spagnoligroup�s data found that phenotype of peripheral bloodCD11bCD16myeloid cells had no difference betweenhealthy donors and CRC patients without capecitabinetherapy Fig S1F and G Secondly our work indicated that CD16 highpositive expression after capecitabine therapy predicted sensitivity to the therapyand good prognosis These results were consistentwith the work from Giulio Spagnoli groupthatCD16myeloid cells related to good prognosis of CRCpatientsMDSCs are a heterogeneous population of myeloidcells stay at different stages of differentiation PMNMDSCs are a great part of MDSCs that could be considered as counterparts of immature granulocytes chieflyimmature neutrophils []In this study we founddownregulation of CD16 expression on myeloid cells incapecitabineinsensitive CRC patients after capecitabinetreatment These CD16low��myeloid cells after the therapy were mainly immature neutrophils CD16 is a lowaffinity Fc� receptor which could activate antibodydependent process like phagocytosis in neutrophils andother phagocytes [] It is expressed on neutrophilsduring the maturation Researchers also revealed thatCD16 is typically associated with PMN activation andphagocytosis and its expression will change in differentmaturation status [ ] MDSCs could exert protumor roles mainly through inhibition of effective Tcells and NK cells [ ] Our study demonstrated thatlow expression of CD16 on neutrophils after the therapywas related to decreased frequencies of antitumor immune cells like CD8T cells and NK cells suggestingthatthey may have immunosuppressive activity asMDSCs The mechanism underlying the changes induced by capecitabine would be investigated further andit could be a good target to compete against capecitabinechemoresistanceConclusionsIn conclusion CD16 seems to be a promising target

[]According to the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology[] systemic opioids given to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery with general anesthesia activate opioidreceptors and stimulate various ans This often results in nausea and vomiting pruritus urinary retentionexcessive sedation and respiratory inhibition Thusinprinciple systemic opioids are not used for postoperativepain relief after day surgery The analgesic and adversereactions of mixed agonistantagonist opioids such asnalbuphine and dezocine also exhibit a ceiling effectImplementation of multimodal analgesia using NSAIDscan significantly reduce the dose of opioid and adversereactions and can be used postoperatively to managemoderate pain after ambulatory surgeryNalbuphine a mixed agonistantagonist opioid is associated with milder μ receptorrelated side effects Itsplasma halflife is  h and in clinical studies the durationof analgesic activity ranges from  to  h [] In ourstudy the VAS at rest of group E was less than  pointsand the difference was statistically significant comparedwith the VAS at rest before administration This indicates that nalbuphine could effectively relieve pain afterambulatory surgery Similar results were also observedin animal studies that showed amelioration of somaticand visceral pain in mice after treatment with nalbuphine []In the present study the VAS at rest at timepoints T1to T4 of the nalbuphine group group E did not differfrom that of the control At T5 the VAS at rest of thenalbuphine group was significantly lower than that ofthe tramadol group This indicates that the duration ofnalbuphine for pain relief after ambulatory surgery waslonger than that of tramadol There were  cases of adverse reactions in the nalbuphine group which wasnot significantly different from the  cases  in thetramadol groupThe incidence of adverse reactions associated with nalbuphine is relatively low compared with other opioidmedications A metaanalysis of randomized controlledtrials by Zeng  [] showed that nalbuphine hassimilar analgesic effects compared to morphine and abetter drug safety profile with a low incidence of postoperative pruritusrespiratory inhibition nausea andvomiting In addition studies have reported that antagonism of the μ receptor by nalbuphine could reduce theadverse reactions of other opioids as seen in the combination of morphine and nalbuphine in patientcontrolled analgesia or patientcontrolled epidural analgesia [ ] and the rate of adverse effects such asurinary retention related to morphine pruritus and nausea was significantly less Nalbuphine with sufentanilused in patientcontrolled analgesia could reduce the 0cGuan  BMC Anesthesiology            Page  of incidence of opioidrelated nausea and vomiting and improved patients� satisfaction with analgesia [ ]In the present study the difference in respiratoryrates before and after administration in both the nalbuphine and tramadol groups was not statistically significant and no respiratory depression was observedMany studies have reported that respiratory depression caused by nalbuphine is small and has a ceilingeffect [ ] In one study a neonate was wronglyadministered a tenfold higher dose than required ofnalbuphine and it resulted in only prolonged sedationwith no respiratory failure []studyIn the presentStudies have shown that preanesthetic injections ofnalbuphine could reduce stress responses and fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate during intubation [ ]the bloodpressures and heart rates of both groups after administration were significantly lower than at T1 althoughstill within normal ranges The blood pressure at T0Inception of the study was compared to the bloodpressure after surgery T1T5 the blood pressure atT1 was significantly higher than at T0 However atthe later timepoints T2 to T5 there were no statistical differences in the blood pressures compared toT0 The decrease in blood pressure after administration T2T5 may have been due to the alleviation ofpain If sothen the lowered blood pressure couldalso indicate the analgesic efficacy of nalbuphineThere are several limitations in this study First a limited number of parameters VAS score adverse eventsand change of vital signs were observed within the halflife of the medication Secondly the VAS scores were recorded at rest and not during movement Finally due toethical issues a placebo control group was not possibleTherefore we were not able to assess the effectiveness ofnalbuphine or tramadol at  and  h after administration Fortunately none of the patients dropped out during the  or  h after administration of medication forpain However the present results warrant further experiments to determine comprehensively the effectiveness and safety of nalbuphine for the treatment of painafter ambulatory surgeryConclusionThis study indicates that nalbuphine at a recommendeddose of  mgkg is safe and effective for pain management after ambulatory

were specifically reduced inSCI patients Thus it is possible that SIBO is overlookedin patients with SCI In our caseit is unclear whenSIBO occurred relative to the time of SCI but we suspect that it arose due to gastrointestinal motility disorder caused by autonomic disturbancesDisturbances in fat absorption and deficiency in fatsoluble vitamins ie vitamins A K E and D3 areobserved in patients with SIBO [] Excess bacteria inthe small intestine promotes a change from conjugatedbile acid into deconjugated bile acid which decreasesthe micellar solubilization of dietary fat Bacterial fermented short chain fatty acid causes osmotic watermovement to the intestinal lumen which results in diarrhea and malabsorption [] Intestinal epithelial damagein SIBO also interferes with fat absorption Mucosaldamage is caused by metabolites of aerobic bacteria endotoxins of anaerobic bacteria and lithocholic acidwhich is a bacterial degradation product of unconjugatedbile acid [�] Our patient however showed constipation rather than diarrhea in spite of SIBO Whether ornot diarrhea occurs in patients with SIBO is determinedby multiple factors Constipation frequently occurs inpatients with SCI due to decreased physical activity andautonomic dysfunction De Looze  reported that therate of constipation in the patients with SCI is  []A certain proportion of the patients with SCI show constipation in spite of the coexisting SIBO Cheng  reported that in patients with both SCI and SIBO showed constipation [] We believe that the factorsleading to constipation in our patient were stronger thanthose leading to diarrhea Vitamin D deficiency in SIBOcauses osteomalacia Our patientshowed multiplefractures and osteoporosis with serum vitamin D3 levelsbelow thetosupplementationrefractorydetectionlimitandThere is no consensus on the choice dose or durationof antibiotics for treating SIBO [] In principle antibiotics should be chosen based on the results of an antimicrobial susceptibility test but this approach cannotaddress the great diversity in microbiota of the digestivetract [ ] Metronidazole is a firstline choice forSIBO [] with other choices being rifaximin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin amoxicillinclavulanate trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole cephalexin or their combination []However these antibodies are selected based on customrather than scientific evidence [] In our case we usedoral polymyxin B and amphotericin B in accordancewith SDD which was first reported as a method of preventing ventilationassociated pneumonia and microbialtranslocation of gramnegative rod bacteria and fungi incritically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit[�] Polymyxin B administered to the digestive tractis nonabsorbent into the human body and has strongbactericidal power against gramnegative rod bacteriaexcept for naturally polymyxinresistant bacteria such asProteus Providencia Manella Burkholderia and Serratia [] Amphoteric B is an antifungal drug that isalso nonabsorbent into the human body when administered to the digestive tract In our case after startingSDD fatsoluble vitamins were increased and osteoporosis was improved No obvious adverse effects of SDD 0cKubota  BMC Gastroenterology            Page  of such as antibioticassociated diarrhea were observed inour caseWhen and how to stop antibiotherapy for the treatment of patients with SIBO are difficult problemsFew reports are available for the method and timingfor making a decision to stop antibiotherapy in SIBOLauritano  reported that the recurrence rate at months after stopping antibiotherapy in SIBO patientsis  [] They also showed that an older age history of appendectomy and chronic use of PPIs areassociated with SIBO recurrence Bures  reportedthat cyclical gastrointestinal selective antibiotics areneeded for SIBO treatment [] These reports indicatethat in many patients with SIBO it is actually impossible to stop antibiotherapy because of the underlyingconditions that lead to SIBO Similarly in our case itwas difficult to ameliorate the underlying condition ofdecreased motility of the digestive tract due to SCIWe were compelled to continue SDD for a long duration We did however succeed in gradually reducingthe dose of polymyxin B and end the use of amphotericin B without signs of SIBO recurrence Withcareful consideration it may be possible and feasibleto stop SDD completelyProbiotics are also a treatment approach for SIBO assome species of bacteria are thought to protect againsthigh numbers of E coli and fungi in the digestive tract[] However the role and effects of probiotics are stillunclear The digestive tract microbiome has both pathogenic potential and a protective role in maintaininghealth However metagenomic analysis reveals that � of microanisms in the digestive tract cannot becultured under laboratory conditions [] The effects ofSDD and probiotics on the digestive tract microbiome inpatients with SIBO should be investigated to furtherunderstand the pathogenesis of the diseaseIn conclusion we treated a patient with a sacral pressure sore who also had SCI multiple fractures withosteoporosis and malabsorption especially of fatsolublevitamins Based on culture of upper digestive tract content we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and startedSDD using polymyxin B and amphotericin B which effectively ameliorated the absorbency disturbance andallowed healing of the pressure sore In light of severalcommon risk factors between pressure sores and SIBOsuch as decreased physical activity our case providesadditional

completely reliable and wesuggest that researchers may require multiplemeasures selfreport and medicationbased measures of morbidity to fully capture accurate prevalence estimates of multimorbidity Our study identified several limitations of thecurrent versions of the RxRisk indices which require updating if medicationbased measures ofmorbidity are to be used to assess the epidemiologyof chronic conditions and multimorbiditytheofIndeedattentionBackgroundMultimorbidity is commonly defined as the presence oftwo or more chronic medical conditions and its prevalence has been shown to increase with age [] As theworld�s older population continues to grow multimorbidity has become an important public health issue caphealthcareturingresearchersprofessionals as well as policy makersforhealthcare systems to effectively adapt and manage thedelivery of healthcare to our growing older populationan accurate description of the epidemiology of chronicconditions is required However to date studies in theliterature reveal wide disparities in prevalence estimatesof multimorbidity ranging from  to  [ ] Thislarge variability is thought to be due to the lack of standards defining multimorbidity and validated methods forhow it should be measured [] A recent systematic review reported  definitions of multimorbidity involving  differenttheappropriateness of different measures of multimorbidityis also variable depending on both the outcome of interest as well as the type of data that is available []In additioncriteria[]Measures of multimorbidity include diagnosisbasedmeasures eg Charlson Index based on hospital diagnosis codes ICD codes [] medicationbased measureseg RxRisk and RxRiskV for those aged �� yearsbased on pharmacy data [] and patient selfreportDiagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity are themost common measures and are generally based on hospital or physician records [] Medicationbased measures of multimorbidity include the RxRisk and RxRiskV � two algorithms which determine an individual�scurrent comorbidities based on their dispensed medication The RxRisk indexes only include morbidities forwhich a medicine could be prescribed and include categories of morbidities based on the World Health anisation WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Classification ATC system [�] The RxRisk and RxRiskVhave good reliability and criterion validity against ICD9diagnoses and have been shown to predict costs of caremortality and health care utilisation [] Previous studies have reported medicationbased measures of morbidity such as the Medicines Disease Burden Index MDBIand RxRiskV to be useful in epidemiological studieswhen adjusting for comorbidity [] However there arefew studies describing the use of these indices to directlymeasure chronic conditions Patient selfreport is also avalid method of identifying disease categories A study ofolder patients with multimorbidity reported good agreement between patient selfreport and general practitioner GP report for a wide range of diseases []A number of studies have compared the differentmeasures of multimorbidity with differing results [ ] A study of older primary care patients inIreland found that medicationbased measures ofmultimorbidity such as RxRiskV performed betterthan diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity inpredicting emergency and ambulatory care sensitiveACS admissions [] Studies comparing patientselfreport and diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity have reported a stronger association between selfreport measures of multimorbidity andqualitythandiagnosisbased measures [ ] However no previous research has compared selfreported morbidityin the primary care or community setting with theRxRisk measures of morbidity Comparison betweenselfreported morbidity data and pharmacy records isimportant in order to understand the relative meritsof each measure of morbidity and the potential formisclassification particularly in the community setting where access to medical or clinical data can belimitedfunctionaloutcomesandlifeofStudies have also indicated that agreement betweenselfreport measures and other measures of morbiditymight be influenced by patient recall bias [] Patientrecall has been reported to be influenced by age maritalstatus and education [] There is also some evidencethat cognition and memory influence patient recall []The impact of these factors needs to be explored furtherwhen assessing and comparing measures of morbidityThe aim of this study was to  compare the agreementbetween patient selfreported morbidity and medicationbased morbidity RxRisk and RxRiskV and  examine potential patientlevel predictors of discordance between theincludingdemographic cognitive and mental

Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate overall survival notably at  months with the Carey and Walter indexes [ ] These two scores consider dependency comorbidities with cancer and malnutrition Walter

Overall psychological distress was common with high levels of moderate to severedepression anxiety and stress Global PSQI scores were significantly positively associated with depression and anxietywith the strongest correlation seen with stress scores Depression scores were also moderately associated with daytimedysfunction Stress was identified as a significant predictor of overall sleep qualityConclusions Sleep problems are common within the population of dementia caregivers Due to the nature andduration of caregiving and the progression of dementia of the care recipient there is the potential for a decline in thecaregivers� mental and physical health Caregivers of those living with dementia are more likely to have comorbiditiesdepression anxiety and stress Sleep quality is

accepted thatbetween  and  of people affected have no formaldementia diagnosis [] This growing epidemic effects notonly the individuals living with dementia but also theirfamilies caring for them the communities they live in andthe health care systems they rely uponFamily or friends are often key informal caregivers forpeople living with dementia [ ] Globally over billion hours ofinformal care is provided to peopleliving with dementia [ ] Whilst providing this carecan be highly rewarding it has also been described as achronic stressor with caregivers reporting low qualityand quantity of sleep [] and high levels of stress anddepression [] In fact sleep disruption is prevalentamongst dementia caregivers with over  of caregiversexperiencing sleep disturbances []The National Sleep Foundation recommend that olderadults �� years require seven to  h sleep for optimalphysical and psychological wellbeing [] Yet numerousstudies have illustrated that dementia caregivers sleepsignificantly less than that with estimates reporting mostcaregivers sleep less than  h per night [] Not only arecaregivers sleeping less than they should the sleep theydo get is of significantly lower quality than their noncaregiver counterparts []Poor sleep is associated with a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes including hypertensionobesity mood disorders and dementia [] A disruptedsleep pattern is also recognised as a significant factor inpredicting caregiver strain [ ] and perhaps more importantly in predicting placing an individual into long termcare [] Enabling people living with dementia to stay athome rather than transfer to longterm care is the optimaloutcome for many families However this cannot be to thedetriment of the caregiver�s own physical andor psychological wellbeing Therefore in order to support the personliving with dementia PLWD to remain in the communitymaintaining caregiver health is vital Given the pivotal rolesleep has in a myriad of physiological processes it is essential to optimise and preserve caregivers sleepDespite the important role sleep plays in dementiacaregiver health it remains an understudied populationparticularly within the

reversalof hyper stressed state Respite services have been cited asan important measure to allow caregivers time to attend totheir own health imperative to supporting the caregiver tocontinue in providing care for their loved one []A recent Australian parliamentary inquiry into sleephealth identified sleep as a foundation of positive healthand wellbeing alongside diet and exercise [] Furthermore the report urged government to prioritise sleephealth as a national priority given its pivotal role inmaintaining health It is clear that caregivers of PLWDhave suboptimal sleep which is associated with poorerpsychological wellbeing and potential increased risk ofdeveloping chronic health conditions such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease [] Interestingly cardiovascular disease and endocrine disease such as diabeteswere the most prevalent comorbidities in our studypopulation Previous studies have also identified highblood pressure diabetes and arthritis as the most prevalent chronic disease in the dementia caregiver groupwhich is in keeping with our findings []Managing sleep and its associated mediators will havedirect impact on both the caregiver�s own health as wellas the caregiver care recipient relationship It is imperative to provide educational support around sleep considerpractical interventions such as overnight respite and toaddress stress management interventions for caregivers inturn reinstating and preserving sleep of this critical population of informal caregiversLimitationsA limitation of this study was the small sample size despitenumerous attempts to recruit participants and involvementof national anisations Although over  participantsprovided demographic details only  participants completed all questionnaires and were included in statisticalanalyses Challenges related to recruiting caregivers andparticularly caregivers of people living with dementia hasbeen described in numerous publications [   ]Caregivers of people with dementia living in the community are more likely to be female and this was representedin our population Furthermore caregivers who are underthe greatest stress may also be those least likely to participate However this remains one of the larger studies ofAustralian dementia caregivers sleep Another limitationwithin this study was that no data was collected regardingthe severity of dementia or behavioural disturbances whichmay impact sleep of the caregiverConclusionSleep problems are widespread within the population ofdementia caregivers Given that the majority of peopleliving with dementia are reliant on family caregiversminimising health and psychologicalimpact on caregivers should be of major concern Furthermore sleepquality is correlated with emotional distress in dementiacaregivers so improving the sleep of caregivers may inturn improve their psychological wellbeing Converselystress is a significant predictor of poor sleep so managing stress may have a positive impact on sleepDementia caregivers are often older with coexistingmorbidities and high levels of psychological distress Withprolonged caregiving and the progression of dementia ofthe care recipient there is the potential for a concurrent decline in the caregivers mental and physical health In orderto support the caregiver in their role it is of the upmost importance that we promote and maximises their health andwellbeing By managing and minimising the negative factorsassociated with caregiving we can enhance caregiving satisfaction and gratification In turn this can ensure

outcomes of malignant gliomas differsignificantly between adults and children [] A numberof studies have showed that the tumorprone locationshistopathology prognosis and some molecular markersare different in glioma patients of different ages [ ]Growing research has shown that the molecular characteristics of GBM in elderly patients are more aggressivethan those in young patients [] Childhood

prognosis of glioma is particularly severe in older adults [ ] The clinical practicepatterns show that with increasing age the applicationof surgical resection radiotherapy and chemotherapy decreases [�] Nevertheless some elderly patients withglioblastoma can benefitfrom these therapies []These elderly patients will receive aggressive treatmentwith radiation or chemotherapy When consideringtreatment options for children with gliomas neurosurgeons will try to avoid the deleterious effects of radiotherapy on the developing brains of children Minimaldysfunction resulting from glioma and treatment shouldbe achieved as much as possible with the expectation ofchildren living to adulthood [] Moreover age isregarded as an important factor related to the prognosisof glioma patients Thereforefor patients diagnosedwith glioma age should be taken into consideration toperform personalized treatment for a better outcomeHowever the criterion for appropriately dividing agegroups of glioma patients remains an unresolved clinicalproblemA large number of studies used different age groupings and these studies led us to differential sabout the prognosis value of age in glioma patients [ ] These contradictory s could be partlyexplained by the difference in age classification criteriabetween different studies In one study a multivariateCox regression model with different cutoff points wasused to analyze the effect of age on OS but only threeage groups were compared and univariate analysis wasperformed using prognostic factors as a classification criterion [] OS is a good indicator for evaluating patientoutcomes but confounding factors such as tumor sizetumor location surgical resection extent and patientcompliance might impair the accuracy of the relationship between age and OSTo avoid the disturbance of confounding factors asmuch as possible our study used the WHO grade of glioma as a dependent variable to assess the prognosis ofglioma patients The classification criteria for glioma patients based on age were � years old pediatric groupand � years old youth group � years oldmiddleaged group and ��  years old elderly groupThis age group classification can be used for preliminaryevaluation of newlydiagnosed glioma patients and helpsto perform precise management in clinical practice according to age group Besides we found that EGFRpositive expression was more common in the middleage group and the EGFR expression in IDH1mut gliomas was more apparent Therefore patients withIDH1mut glioma aged � years old might benefitfrom EGFR inhibitor therapy Based on this age groupclassification we further analyzed the characteristics ofWHO grade tumor size tumor histology and anatomical location among the four age groups We found thatthe proportion of WHO grade IV gliomas and positiveexpression of Ki67 Oligo2 and IDHwt increased significantly in elderly age groups In addition in the olderage group more patients suffered from a heavy tumorburden tumor size   cm Regarding the histology ofglioma pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common inchildren while glioblastoma accounts for the largest proportion of adult groups Many studies have demonstrated that patients with a higher grade of glioma havea worse outcome [] Moreover a larger tumor burdenmight cause a higher risk of functional deficits includingmotor dysfunction impaired communication ability ordecline in neurocognitive function [] Therefore theprognosis of patients with gliomas can initially be evaluated according to age On the other hand patientsgrouping according to age has been widely used in clinical studies but there is no uniform standard of agegroup classification for patients with glioma The agegroup established on the basis of objective pathologicaldiagnosis in this study will be helpful for clinical trialsdesign in the futureGlioma especially glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy In addition to the marked heterogeneity of tumor size and histopathology the heterogeneityof the molecular characteristics of tumors is becomingincreasingly important and is reported in several studiesAccording to the  WHO classification glioma isfirst classified according to histologicalfeatures andthen more subtypes are classified according to molecularcharacteristics There are a variety of indicators that arewidely used in clinical practice such as GFAP EMAMGMT P53 NeuN Oligo2 EGFR VEGF IDH1 Ki671p19q and these indicators are highly correlated withthe prognosis of the patients [�] Agedependentoccurrence and the effects of different biological markershave been reported in malignancies [] For examplethe association between age and tumor grade Ki67markers apoptosis index EGFR expression and erbB2expression has been reported in breast cancer [] Astudy indicated that the prognostic effects of P53 1pand CDKN2Ap16 alterations are dependent on patientage [] Increasing translational studies have significantly advanced the understanding of glioma pathogenesis and have identified several prognostic factorsHigher tumor grade older age [] and increased expression of molecular biomarkers such as P53 []MGMT [] PR []

andtheir infants in United Arab Emirates [] However nullor detrimental associations were also reported in otherstudies Although vitamin D increased the mean birthweight it did not significantly reduce the risk of low birthweight or preterm birth in a metaanalysis based on randomized trials [] these results were further supported byanother update study [] In addition higher 25OHDconcentrations were found to increase the  riskof preterm delivery in a prospective study of pregnant Chinese women []Gestational vitamin D deficiency was found to be associated with a 2fold increased risk of cesarean section ina cohort of  lowincome pregnant women []Within a cohort of  women from the United Statesfor women with 25OHD concentrations lower than nmolL the risk of a primary cesarean section wasalmost  times higher [] These results were consistent with ours However a metaanalysis of  trials subjects found null associations of vitamin D supplements with cesarean section []Much heterogeneity exists in the previous evidence inthis field and there may be several factors that partly explain these differences First most of the randomized trials included had a small sample size and were of lowquality Most subjects included in the trials had sufficient vitamin D status �� nmolL and a further doseof a  or  IUd supplement might have attenuatedTable  Subclass analysis of relationship between serum

detrimental influence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in the reference group [] Increasing benefitsmight not exist for higher doses Second the vitamin Dreceptor is important for the utilization of vitamin D[ ] The difference in vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism might help explain the ethnic heterogeneity[] This requires further confirmation in the futureThird the studies were conducted during different trimesters of gestation which might increase the difficultyof making comparisons those studies conducted duringan early gestational period might be advantageous forcausal inference and early preventionBecause 25OHD3 contributes most to the 25OHDconcentrations it has been used to represent 25OHDin many studies and only a few studies have focused on25OHD2 In our study the results were generally consistent between these two subcomponents The associations tend to be more pronounced in 25OHD2 than in25OHD3 and mightindicate the prominence of25OHD2 over 25OHD3 for the prevention of relateddiseases This theory merits further confirmation Nevertheless our results and others provide further evidencefor the importance of a better early vitamin D status forthe prevention of GDM cesarean section preterm birthand low birth weight in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency Our results indicated thatmore consideration should be given to distinguishing between the vitamin D subcomponents women pregnantat different ages and women with more pregnancy complications in this field Considering the high prevalenceof vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy observed inChina [ ] it is a matter of urgency to call for the supplementation of vitamin D and more efforts should bemade to improve the gestational vitamin D status ofChinese populationVitamin D deficiency was found to decrease vasculardiameter within the labyrinth region and dysregulateplacental development during early pregnancy in an animal experiment [] Vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy might rescue this situation while furthersupplementation might be futile after missing this timepoint [] Moreover vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy is likely to affect genetic information ofsystemic inflammation and immune responses involvedin the development of gestational comorbidities egGDM preeclampsia and infection as reviewed by Hollis [] These mechanisms help to explain the beneficialinfluences of vitamin D for maternal and infanthealth and emphasize the importance of improving vitamin D status during early pregnancyOurstudy had several advantages Firstserum25OHD concentrations were measured during an earlygestational period and with the retrospective cohort design we assured the temporal sequence and avoided thepossibility of causal inversion Second we studied multiple outcomes and conducted further analysis of thesubcomponent of vitamin D and a stratified analysis ofgestational age which provided a more comprehensiveunderstanding of this field There are also several limitations of our study First our study was limited by thelack of information on dietary vitamin D intake including by supplement and sunlight exposure during thepregnancy period The obtained data were difficult touse for a retrospective study while the use of blood indicators might be more precise than a dietary survey sowe adjusted the association for different seasons to attenuate their influence Second the 25OHD concentration was measured only once we could not monitor thedynamic changes afterward or determine whether theywere normalized after receiving vitamin D supplementation However the associations tended to be underestimated instead of overestimated Third Wagner et al[] and Mirzakhani  [] indicated a 25OHDconcentration ��  nmolL in early pregnancy was optimal for the prevention of preterm birth and preeclampsia however the highest 25OHD concentration in ourstudy is only  nmolL Therefore we were unable toperform the analyses using a threshold of  nmolLand assess the influences of higher 25OHD concentrations Finally residual confounding might still existthough we tried to control several potential covariatesConclusionsThis retrospective cohort study showed the beneficial associations of early gestational vitamin D with outcomesof GDM cesarean section preterm birth and low birthweight

and is characterized as the most continually occurred tumor amongmen in the United States [] The biggest challenge isthe detectable bone metastases in roughly  advancedprostate cancer [] Virtually all prostate cancer patientsduring  years� androgen deprivation treatment inevitably undergo castrationresistance which contributes tothe poor clinical consequences in prostate cancer []However the mechanism underlaid prostate cancer remains mostly unknownThe widely studied long noncoding RNAs lncRNAsare transcribed from nonproteincoding human genomeand have more than  nt in length [] LncRNAs are increasingly functionally identified and experimentally consolidated to be related to tumor neoplasia and progressionin diverse cancers [] Additionally lncRNAs with dysregulation can functionally modulate tumor developmentfrom multiple pathological aspects such as cell proliferation drugresistance and metastasis [�] For examplelncRNA A1BGAS1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasionin hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting miR216a5p []LncRNA LOC730100 sponges miR760 from FOXA1 toaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion in glioma []LncRNA SNHG16 functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [] Long intergenic nonprotein codingRNA  LINC00992 is a novel lncRNA that has beenpreviously revealed to be elevated in tumors and substantiated as a master regulator for chemoresistance [] Besides LINC00992 has been uncovered as an elevatedlncRNA in prostate cancer [] which is consistent withthe detection from GEPIA database Despite that no previous study has given a comprehensive explanation aboutthe precise function or detailed mechanism of LINC00992in prostate cancerIn past decades the fact that lncRNAs function in tumors depending on their secondary or tertiary structureshas been reported in many cancerlinked studies For instance in the nucleus lncRNAs are entitled to work asmolecular scaffolds or alternative splicing assistants [] On the contrary lncRNAs dispersing in cytoplasm influence downstream mRNA translation or degradationthrough serving as miRNA sponges [ ] For exampleTNFαinduced lncRNA LOC105374902 promotes themalignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells by acting as asponge of miR12853p [] LncRNA TTNAS1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer tumorigenesis by regulatingmiR1533pZNRF2 axis[] Nevertheless whetherLINC00992 could exert its functions in prostate cancer viaits sponging role of certain miRNA remains unknownWe conducted this research aiming to explore thefunction or probable mechanism of LINC00992 in prostate tumor which might enrich the understanding interms of prostate tumor pathology and contribute to awider applied scopeMethodsTissue samplesThe prostate cancer tissue samples and matched peritumor tissue samples

significant difference between twoclusters which further elucidated the relationship between DEGs and immune featuresDue to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patientsidentifying robust prognostic biomarker is very importantThe tumor immune microenvironment is closely relatedto the prognosis of bone tumor patients Emilie etal []performed the first genomewide study to describe therole of immune cells in osteosarcoma and found thattumorassociated macrophages are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survivalin highgradeosteosarcoma Recently the prognostic signature based onTMErelated genes have been established for many tumors [  ] but only one study focused on osteosarcoma patients [] Compared with the study performedby Zhang  [] we think that our research have someadvantages Firstly our signatures were established basedon several validated genes and both two signatures weresuccessfully validated in independent cohorts Secondlythe outcome of DFS was not reported in the previousstudy As reported in published studies tumor recurrenceis a terrible medical problem for osteosarcoma patientsand the 5year survival rate for osteosarcoma patients withmetastasis or relapse remains disappointing [ ]Hence the DFS nomogram can improve the managementof osteosarcoma patients Finally two nomograms incorporated TMErelated signature and clinical variables wereestablished in our research which further facilitated theclinical application of our findingsIn our research five genes were incorporated into thefinal prognostic signatures FCGR2B GFAP and MPP7were identified and validated as OSrelated biomarkerswhile CYP2S1 and ICAM3 were DFSrelated biomarkersThe role of these genes in tumor prognosis had beenwidely reported in previous studies [�] FCGR2Bhas been confirmed as an immunerelated gene previously [] Although the relationship between FCGR2Band prognosis in sarcoma patients had not been reported the prognostic value of FCGR2B had been widelyconfirmed in other cancerssuch as hepatocellularcarcinoma and glioblastoma [ ] In addition NewM etal [] demonstrated that MPP7 is novel regulatorsof autophagy which was thought to be responsible forthe prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaCYP2S1 described as Cytochrome P450 Family  Subfamily S Member  was reported significantly associatedwith colorectal cancer In primary colorectal cancerCYP2S1 was present at a significantly higher level ofintensity compared with normal colon [] More importantly the presence of strong CYP2S1 immunoreactivity was associated with poor prognosis [] The roleof ICAM3 in cancer was also widely reported in published studies and the Akt pathway plays an importantrole in the impact of ICAM3 on tumors YG Kim etal[] reported that ICAM3 can induce the proliferationof cancer cells through the PI3KAkt pathway Additionally JK Park etal showed that the ICAM3 can enhancethe migratory and invasive potential of human nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducing MMP2 andMMP9 via Akt pathway [] showed that the ICAM3can enhance the migratory and invasive potential ofhuman nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducingMMP2 and MMP9 via Akt pathwayAlthough the role of TME and TMErelated genes inosteosarcoma patients have been initially studied by bioinformatic and statistical analyses in our research somelimitations should be elucidated Firstly the treatmentinformation cannot be obtained from the TARGET database which may influence the prognosis of osteosarcomapatients Secondly two nomograms were generated andshowed good performance in our study However externalvalidation by a large cohort is needed Thirdly many independent prognostic genes for osteosarcoma patients wereidentified in the present study but the potential mechanism to influence osteosarcoma remains unclear Finally inthe training cohort  and  DEGs were identified asOS and DFSrelated DEGs respectively However onlyfive OS and five DFSrelated genes were identified in thevalidation cohort The different age structures smaller 0cHu  BMC Cancer            Page  of sample sizes and the platform covering only part of thegenes may contribute to this resultReceived

biomarkers in osteosarcoma patients Howeverfurther researches are needed to study the potentialmechanism and validate the nomogram that developedin our present studySupplementary

diagnosticssurgical techniques and treatment have hardly improvedthe survival rate in the past  years The 5year relativesurvival rate as reported by the American Cancer Societyremains only  [ ]Only � of all patients are eligible for surgery todate the only potential cure [] Approximately � ofall patients with pancreatic cancer have metastatic diseaseat diagnosis and  of all patients have locally advanceddisease with tumor involvement of surrounding vessels orans At the time of surgery approximately � ofthe patients are considered unresectable because of unexpected liver metastasis peritoneal carcinomatosis or locally advanced disease [�]More than  of all liver metastases develop in thefirst six months postoperatively [] These liver metastases are most likely already present at the time of diagnosis and have not been identified preoperatively as theyare too small to be detected by routine preoperativeultrasound and contrastenhanced CT CECT [ ]CECT is highly accurate in assessing the relationship ofthe tumor to critical arterial and venous structures sincetheir involvement can preclude surgical resection HoweverCECT has a poor sensitivity � for the detection andcharacterization of liver metastases [ �] especiallyfor subcentimeter metastases which are often present inpancreatic cancer [] This leads to futile surgical treatment with all the associated morbidity mortality and costsMoreover patients who were explored with curative intentand were found unresectable due to peritoneal or liver metastases had a worse overall survival compared to patientswith unexpected locally advanced disease []Nowadays diffusionweighted MR imaging DWI appears to be valuable in both detection and characterizationof focal liver lesions with a high sensitivity � evenfor subcentimeter lesions � [�] This technique can be used to detect and characterize liver lesionsbased on decreased diffusion of water molecules caused bytumoral hypercellularity and reduced extracellular spaceDWI is especially useful for detecting subcentimeter livermetastasesit is more accurate than conventional T2weighted imaging techniques because signal suppression ofintravascular flow is obtained black blood effect whilemaintaining good residual signal of the liver lesions [] Itis easy to implement and adds very little time to a standardMRI examination However without highquality evidenceof the benefit of MRI the use of MRI as part of the routineworkup is questioned and therefore not implemented Currently most guidelines advise to use MRI as a problemsolving tool in addition to CECT eg when the primarytumor cannot be visualized or in case of undefined liver lesions [�] The American Society of Clinical OncologyASCO leaves the choice of imaging modality in the handsof the physician [] MRI is advised for all patients according to the Japanese guideline however the level of evidenceis low grade C []Most studies that have been performed for liver metasincluding our singletases of PDAC are

Inclusion of patients is expected tobe finished December accuracy ofDiscussionThe purpose of the DIAPANC trial is to investigate thediagnosticcontrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI in patients with suspected PDAC for thedetection of liver metastases Additionally we will evaluatewhether performing contrastenhanced diffusionweightedMRI will improve the detection of liver metastases compared to CECT by determining the sensitivity and specificity of CECT for the detection of liver metastasesDespite the good diagnostic performance of MRI forliver metastases the benefits of MRI remain unclearmostly because of low level of evidence heterogeneityand bias in the performed studies Two recently published metaanalyses have suggested the results shouldbe confirmed by performing a welldesigned and sufficiently powered study directly comparing liver CT andMRI in the same cohort [ ]A major difficulty in the interpretation of the currentliterature is that most studies are retrospective oftenonly reporting on a subset of patients actually undergoing a resection patients with borderline resectable tumors or patients with indeterminate liver lesions onCECT These patients have a higher probability of 0cLitjens  BMC Cancer            Page  of having liver metastases However in an era of neoadjuvant therapy local ablative therapy for advanced tumorsexpensive targeted therapies and resection of oligometastases MRI may be beneficial to patients with allstages of PDAC Therefore all patients with suspectedPDAC are eligible for inclusion in the DIAPANCMRI field strength  T versus  T was a significant factor in the heterogeneity between studies that was found ina metaanalysis  T MRI had a higher sensitivity  anda lower specificity  for diagnosing liver metastasiscompared to  T MRI sensitivity  and specificity[] Because the signaltonoise ratio and thelesiontoliver contrast are higher on  T MRI than on T MRI it is reasonable that a  T MRI permits a higher lesion detection rate [ ] In the DIAPANC study weplan to perform all MRIs on a  T scanner A potentialdownside of a multicenter design is the intervendor variability that could occur when comparing the quantitativeApparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC value this variabilityseems to be more pronounced at  T than at  T []Availability of MRI is not expected to be an issue asMRI is available in every expert center for pancreaticdiseases However problems with MRI capacity couldarise due to the need for MRI within a short intervalafter CT A time interval of two weeks was chosen toprovide a feasible time frame for MRI to be performedand no intervallesions are expected within this timeinterval []The DIAPANC trial is the first international prospective multicenter cohort study about the diagnostic accuracyof contrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI On theWorld Health anization trial registry website ICTRPincorporating all inter national trial registries there areonly four other prospective trials registered in this fieldThe first trialis a completed French prospectivemulticenter trial presumably the only one prospective study that has been published [] The studyhas been performed in  patients with potentiallyresectable pancreatic cancer on a  T scanner usinggadobenate dimeglumine MultiHance as contrastagent The study has been performed to assess thediagnostic performance of diffusionweighted MRIfor the preoperative diagnosis of liver metastasis andthe modification of therapeutic strategy as a consequence ofliver metastasis ondiffusionweighted MRI []the diagnosis ofThe second trial is a British single center observational study with a target sample size of  patientswith confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer referred for pancreaticoduodenectomy and is completed recently The primary outcome of this studyis the proportion of patients correctly identified byMRI to have lymph node peritoneal or liver metastases To our knowledge the results have not beenpublished and there is no information on scan parameters and contrast agent available []The third trial from Australia is the only randomizedcontrolled trial The study has a target sample size of patients and is not yet recruiting The aim of the studyis to compare the 12month recurrence rate in patientswith locally operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with standard preoperative assessment of liver metastases with CECT versus preoperative assessment withliver specific contrast MRI []The fourth trial is a Chinese comparative study and isnot yet recruiting The study aims to compare liver specific contrast MRI and CECT in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer with a target sample size of  patients []The DIAPANC trial hypothesizes a superior value ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT To reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy thegold standard is histopathology of the liver lesions Considering it is not always possible and sometimes even unethical to obtain histopathological proof of every lesionfollowup is used as a reference standard Hence we areable to simultaneously gather information on early localrecurrence or metastases after resection disease progression and therapy response evaluation on MRI and CECTIn conclusion the DIAPANC trial is expected to report highlevel evidence of the diagnostic accuracy ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT resulting in significant value for clinical decisionmaking guideline development and improved stratification for treatment strategies and future trials Furthermore

extracts to treat patients with metastatic advanced breastcancer The condition was significantly alleviated sparkinginterest in exploring the relationship between thyroid andbreast cancer [] Subsequently a prospective study enrolled  women and  women with earlier diagnosisof hypothyroidism observed the occurrence of breast cancer during followup showed that low serum free thyroxine levels increased the risk of breast cancer [] In  aprospective women withhypothyroidism and  hyperthyroidism found thathypothyroidism slightly reduced the risk of breast cancer[] However a prospective cohort study of women with autoimmune hypothyroidism and women with normal thyroid function indicated that autoimmune hypothyroidism was not associated with breastcancer risk [] Besides some animal experiments alsoreflect the relationship between the two [ ] Animalexperiments by López Fontanafound thathypothyroidism mice inhibit the development of breastcancer and promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cellsdue to the low expression of βchain protein and activation of the apoptotic pathway on the tumour cell membrane [] Due to the inconsistency ofthe aboveconclusions we performed a metaanalysis to evaluate therelationship between hypothyroidism and breast cancerrisketalA total of  studies were included in this metaanalysis and the results showed that patients withhypothyroidism not related to the risk of breast cancerHowever there was significant heterogeneity among theincluded studies After subgroup analysis and sensitivityanalysis we found that Cristofanilli�s research may causeheterogeneity [] Cristofanilli�s research is a retrospective study and the diagnosis of hypothyroidism patientswas based on the information recorded in the medicalrecords which may lead to the bias risk of misclassification and have a positive impact on the positive results ofthis study [] After excluding Cristofanilli�s researchwe found that patients with hypothyroidism had a lowerrisk of breast cancer with borderline significance [] Theresults of the metaanalysis are inconsistent with the findings of Hardefeldt  and Angelousi  [ ] Perhaps because our study included more prospective studiesand Asian population cohort study In addition we evaluated the risk of breast cancer in thyroid hormone replacement therapy and show that patients who received thyroidhormone replacement therapy was not related to the riskof breast cancerIn the analysis of the European population the resultsshow that hypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breastcancer We also found that patients with hypothyroidismcan reduce the risk of breast cancer was borderline significance in the subgroup with more longer followupdate However the relationship between the two was notobserved in North American and Asian populationsThe possible reasons for these disparities may be as follows First followup time may be the main contributorsto this difference A longer followup is required to demonstrate the relationship between hypothyroidism andbreast cancer risk In the metaanalysis five studies provided North American population data and two reported Asian population data However only one ofseven nonEuropean studies� followup time for morethan  years Second the differences may be attributedto different ethnicities sharing different genegene andgeneenvironmental backgrounds Third social and environmental factors are another critical cause for thisdifference With these in mind our findings suggest thathypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breast canceronly in the European population and more largescalehighqualitylongterm prospective cohort studies arestill needed to study on different human populationsThe following may explain the potential relationshipbetween hypothyroidism and the risk of breast cancerHealthy mammary epithelial cells can express a largenumber of T3 receptors and breast cancer cells have asimilar ability to bind to T3 [] T3 has an estrogenlike effect that promotes the growth of mammary glandlobes and stimulates normal breast tissue differentiation[ ] Therefore T3 can mimic the effect of estrogenon the proliferation of breast cancer cells When theconcentration of T3 is low in vivo it may inhibit theproliferation of breast cancer cells Hypothyroidism mayreduce the risk of breast cancer by affecting T3concentrationSome basic experiments support this theory In GonzalezSancho  studied the relationship betweenT3 and breast cancer [] It was found that there is anoverexpressed T1 gene in human breast cancer cellsand T3 inhibits the proliferation of mammary epithelialcells by inhibiting the expression of cyclin D1 and T1thereby inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells 0cWang  BMC Cancer            Page  of Author

firstline treatmentinhibitor treatmentImmune checkpointis a newapproach for tumor immunotherapy [ ] The treatment diminishes the immune system tolerance to tumorcells and improves the effective identification and eradication of tumor cells by blocking T cell inhibition [] Theprogrammed death1 PD1 antibody specifically binds toPD1 thereby inhibiting apoptosis of antigenspecific Tcells and thus reducing regulatory T cell Treg apoptosisby inhibiting the activation of PDL1 [ ]patients with recurrent or advanced GC In the ATTRACTION2 study nivolumab monotherapy improvedOS from  to  months

which is considered to beassociated with T cell exclusion or exhaustion or inadequate T cell trafficking and many immunosuppressivefactors accumulate in the tumor microenvironment []New therapy regimens that improve the response andlongterm efficacy are desperately needed The efficacy ofantiPD1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy hasbeen confirmed in nonsmallcell lung cancer [ ] Inaddition to direct tumor killing conventional cytotoxicchemotherapy has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties by enhancing tumor antigenicity disturbing immunesuppressive pathways inducing immunogenic cell deathand increasing effector Tcell reactions [] It is safe tohypothesize that antiPD1 antibodies in combination withchemotherapy may further improve the clinical outcomesof patients with advanced GC Sintilimab is a highly selective monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interactionsbetween PD1 and its ligands with strong antitumorresponse [] A phase 1a study for dose escalation

the efficacy of PD1 treatments inconsistentresults have been reported in previous studies Wang  suggested that TMB might be associatedwith better efficacy for PD1 monotherapy [] whereasMishima  [] did not find a significant relationshipbetween TMB and the response of gastric cancers toPD1 therapy [] The latter data is in accordance withour finding that after treatment with sintilimab in combination with CapeOx no significant difference in theclinical responses was found between HTMB and LTMB patients However using the median TMB as acutoff is difficult to extrapolate to the real world clinicand bias due to the small sample size could not beexcluded in the present study In addition it has beennoted that up to now there is no uniform standard forHTMB [] and further investigations are

tongue squamous cell carcinomaImmunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of TROP2 in poorly differentiated OSCC tissueswas significantly higher than that in welldifferentiatedOSCC tissues Additionally TROP2 upregulation wascorrelated with tumors of advanced TNM III  IV staging and poor differentiation than that in tumors withlow TNM I  II staging Thus the abnormal expressionof TROP2 may be associated with the occurrence anddevelopment of tongue malignancies Furthermore highTROP2 expression predicted low survival as comparedto that in the tumors with low TROP2 expression Previous research has also demonstrated the correlation between shorter patient lifespan and high levels of TROP2as compared to that in patients with laryngeal squamouscell carcinoma and low levels of TROP2 [] TROP2possesses sites for tyrosineserine phosphorylation thatregulate signal transduction or its expression and activity thereby rendering cancer cells resistant to apoptosis[] Upregulated TROP2 correlates with the poor prognosis of thyroid papillary carcinoma [] colon cancer[] liver cancer [] and other malignanciesThere have been an increasing number of studies on thebiological role of TROP2 at the molecular level TROP2induces the downregulationloss of PTEN thereby stimulating PI3KAKT signaling and tumor development []PTEN is a wellknown tumor suppressor that is a phosphatase [] and affects the PI3KPKBAKT signaling axisduring the dephosphorylation of PIP2 and PIP3 []PI3K signaling is important in regulating tumor cell proliferation migration and invasion [ ] Thus PTEN is anegative regulator of cancer [ ] Li  have shownthat TROP2 activates epithelialmesenchymal transitionvia PI3KAKT signaling thereby promoting proliferationmigration and metastasis in gallbladder cancer [] Similarly TROP2 expression stimulates the proliferation migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells [] Hou et aldemonstrated that TROP2 regulates JAK2STAT3 signaling in glioblastoma cells []

WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0cThyroid  diseases  requiring  surgery  are  relatively uncommon in children compared to adults The prevalence  of  palpable  thyroid  nodules  in  children  ranges  from    to    Sporadic  welldifferentiated thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy in children accounting for  of pediatric cancers  in  the  prepubertal  age  group  and  up  to   of cancers in adolescents aged � year2 The most common indication for thyroid surgery in children varies among published studies but thyroidectomy for malignant conditions is rising38 Data in children throughout the  world  are  relatively  scarce  The  objective  of  this study was to analyze the clinical data and outcome of thyroid  surgery  in  a  large  series  of  children  treated  at a  single  center  at  King  Faisal  Specialist  Hospital  and Research Center KFSHRC in RiyadhPATIENT AND METHODS With the approval of the Institutional Review Board IRB at KFSHRC the medical records of all patients  years old and younger who underwent a thyroid surgery between    and    were  retrospectively  reviewed We elected to include patients up to the year  to ensure a reasonable followup period Patients for the study were identified by a search of the operating room log for all procedures involving the thyroid gland for the specified age groupDemographic  data  clinical  features  and  surgical outcomes  were  collected  Specific  data  that  were  obtained included age at operation gender family history presenting  symptoms  history  of  radiation  exposure presence of multiple endocrine

and  completion  thyroidectomy Surgeries were performed by either an endocrine adult surgeon or a pediatric surgeon No intraoperative nerve monitoring was used Early in the series procedures were performed by adult endocrine surgeons but lately a combined approach was adopted where pediatric surgeons and adult endocrine surgeons collaborated in such cases  proceduresthe normal range in our laboratory regardless of symptoms Transient hypocalcemia was identified if it lasted for less than  months while permanent hypocalcemia was  considered  if  the  serum  calcium  level  remained below normal range and the patient continued on calcium  supplementation  after    months  of  the  surgery All patients with a family history of MEN  underwent genetic testing of the RET protooncogene to confirm the diagnosis All patients who underwent completion thyroidectomy  had  a  preoperative  and  postoperative vocal  cords  assessment  at  the  Otolaryngology  clinic Descriptive data were generated and comparisons were conducted using the t test for continuous data and the chisquare or Fisher exact tests for proportionsRESULTSBetween    and      patients  underwent   surgical

or only after a recurrence All local recurrences  underwent  resection  except  for  one  patient who was lost follow up There was no mortality in this study DISCUSSIONThe most common indication for thyroidectomy in this series was thyroid nodule which correlates with previously published reports in the pediatric population35 Children with thyroid nodules have an estimated fourfold  higher  risk  of  developing  thyroid  cancer  compared to adults910 The high incidence of malignancy in this series suggests children with a thyroid nodule should be carefully evaluatedFNA is a valuablemethod for preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules However there are limitations on  the  routine  use  of  FNA  in  children  including  the need  for  sedation  sampling  errors  and  the  limited availability  of  experienced  cytopathologists11  Many previous studies reported high sensitivity and specificity of FNA in evaluating thyroid nodule in children1114 which correlate with our findingsOur data showed lymph node metastasis in  of  thyroid  cancer  cases  which  supports  the  notion that  children  with  thyroid  cancer  frequently  present with more extensive disease than adults Lymphnode involvement  at  diagnosis  is  seen  in    to    of children  compared  with    to    of  adults  with differentiated thyroid cancer1523 Because our hospital is the largest referral center in Saudi Arabia especially for oncology cases this may explain the large number of lymph node and distant metastasis In this cohortThe  most  common  complication  reported  after thyroidectomy in children is hypoparathyroidism with an incidence ranging between  to  which original PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0ccorresponds with our results of  which are reported as hypocalcemia in Table    One study found that total thyroidectomy central and bilateral neck dissection Graves� disease and malignancy were  risk  factors  for  hypocalcemia  after  thyroid  surgery3 In this cohort postoperative hypocalcemia was noted more in malignant cases but it failed to reach statistical significance Moreover there was no significant difference between benign and malignant cases in  terms  of  mean  age  gender  distribution  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or overall complications a finding that was reported previously26 Multiple studies in recent years have found an inverse relationship between surgeon volume and complication  rates2728  but  similar  data  in  the  pediatric population is lacking One study found that highvolume  endocrine  surgeons  have  better  outcomes  and shorter lengths of stay and lower costs after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy in children compared to pediatric surgeons general surgeons or otolaryngologists29  Scheumann  and  colleagues  also  concluded that a collaborative approach between pediatric and endocrine surgeons would have better outcomes This has led other authors to suggest that a combined approach with endocrine and pediatric surgeons in addition to pediatric endocrinologists may optimize the care of children with surgical thyroid disease given the low number of pediatric patients4 Our data do not allow for comparisons of different approaches given the late adoption of the combined approach The  recurrence  rate  for  thyroid  cancer  in  children after  thyroidectomy  has  varied  widely  in  reported studies  ranging  from    to    while  it  was   in  this  cohort  Only  a  few  studies  explored  the predictors  of  recurrence  Lymph  node  involvement multiple nodules male gender younger age histologic subtype and advanced tumor stage were risk factors associated with recurrence17233033 In  this  study    of  patients  with  malignant  lesions received RAI Although there are conflicting data regarding  the  indications  of  postoperative  RAI  treatment in lowrisk patients the current recommendation is that lowrisk patients can be treated without RAI3436There are some limitations to this study The retrospective nature may affect the validity and quality of the data The small number of cases in some categories did not enable us to compare groups and explore predictors relative to these factors On the other hand this study adds to the scarce data on thyroid surgery in pediatric age group Malignancy is the commonest indication  for  thyroid  surgery  in  children  and  FNA  is highly  diagnostic  Hypocalcemia  and  recurrent  laryngeal nerve injury are significant complications Cancerrelated  death  is  extremely  rare  but

 four  disjoint  citation  subsets The first query QPub_plain is based on a plaintext search in PubMed titles and s using keywords The  second  query  QPub_indexed relies on the PubMed indexing scheme using MeSH terms and results are made exclusive of the previous set The third one QWoS_restricted is based on a plaintext search in WoS restricted to the two research areas �Medical Informatics� and �Health Care Sciences  Services� The fourth query QWoS_filtered is based on the same plaintext search used in WoS but filtered by nonrelevant research areas eg Archeology Dance Zoology etc and the two research areas of the previous query It is of note that the two WoS queries select  only  nonPubMedindexed  papers that are supposed to be caught by the two PubMed queriesA  first  review  of  the  four  subsets  of retrieved  citations  was  performed  by  the two section editors to select  candidate best papers Following the IMIA Yearbook protocol these candidate best papers were then individually reviewed and rated by both section editors the chief editor of the Decision Support section and external reviewers from the international Medical Informatics community Based on the reviewers� ratings and comments the Yearbook editorial committee then selected the best papers of the year in the decision support domainIMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics                                    IMIA and Ge Thieme Verlag KG 0cReview Results The    literature  search  has  been  performed on January   A total of  unique references were obtained distributed as follows  for QPub_plain  for QPub_indexed  for QWoS_restricted and  for QWoS_filtered yielding subtotals of  references from PubMed and  from WoS Compared to the previous year the global query retrieved   more  papers After  a  first  individual screening independently performed by both section editors based on the title and  of papers  not rejected by both section editors were discussed by the two editors to achieve a final selection of  candidate best  papers After  the  external  review  of these    s  the  editorial  committee finally selected three of them as best papers for  [�] Table  They are discussed in the next section and summaries of their contents are available in the AppendixDiscussion and OutlookIn the first paper Hendriks  [] propose an approach to the modeling of clinical practice guidelines which certainly builds on already existing approaches but which is systematically conducted in order to be scalable and used to represent complex guidelines They promote the formalism of clinical decision trees CDTs as they are both clinically interpretable  by  healthcare  professionals and  computerinterpretable  thus  suitable for implementation in datadriven CDSSs The disambiguation of textual guidelines is supported first by the formal unequivocal specification of data items used as decision criteria using international coding systems to enforce interoperability and second by the representation of guideline knowledge as CDTs The method is applied to the Dutch breast cancer guidelines Sixty CDTs were built  involving  a  total  of    data  items among  which    could  not  be  linked  to standard terminologies The authors report the ambiguity of certain criteria which could be subjective or had multiple definitions The resulting knowledge base was implemented in a decision support application where it can be interactively browsed or automatically executed By modeling guidelines in such a way this work is a step forward in the sharing of encoded knowledgeIn the second paper Kamišalić  [] tackled the issues linked to the formalization of the medical processes used for managing chronic diseases and their execution in CDSSs They analyzed the decisionmaking dimensions of the therapeutic management of chronic diseases like those known to increase the cardiovascular risk and identified three basic levels therapy strategy dosage adaptation and intolerance management To handle these  different  aspects  consistently  they propose a formalism called extended Timed Transition Diagram eTTD With eTTDs they illustrate the multilevel and finegrained modeling required to capture the contents of arterial hypertension management guidelines This detailed demonstration on how procedural knowledge for hypertension management can be formalized to develop a CDSS could certainly be used in other medical domainsThe third paper by Khalifa  [] presents a conceptual and practical framework to help assess confidence in predictive tools GRASP  for  Grade  and Assess  Predictive Tools is both a method to look for evidence from the published literature and an analysis grid It standardizes the assessment of the available literature associated to a predictive tool and the grading of its level of proof Three phases of evaluation are considered i before the implementation of the tool to assess both its internal and external validity ii during the implementation to assess its potential effect and usability and iii after the implementation to assess its effectiveness and safety In each phase the level of evidence  can  be  assessed  from  the  study design A qualitative  summarizes the direction of evidence positive negative mixed This grid can be considered as similar to existing grids for instance the CONSORT statement for clinical trials However it gives a rigorous methodology for a critical appraisal of predictive tools and could be extended to all kind of CDSSs It might be a useful tool to extend the evidencebased culture in the field of medical informaticsBesides the three best papers selected for the  Decision  Support section  of  the   edition of the IMIA Yearbook several other works retrieved from the literature review deserve to be cited Some of them deal with the personalization of decisions Laleci   []  propose  a  scientific  and  technical approach to develop personalized care plans that comply with clinical practice guidelines for the management of complex polypathology situations Jafarpour  [] propose a solution to dynamically manage the conflicts that can rise in this type of complex contexts Ben Souissi  [] introduce the use of health  information  technology  involving multiple criteria decision to support the choice between antibiotics alternatives Interestingly other works promote the creation and sharing of operational knowledge bases as exemplified by Hendriks  [] Thus Huibers  [] transform the textual STOPPSTART criteria into unambiguous definitions mapped to  medical  terminologies  Canovas et  al [] formalize EUCAST expert rules as an ontology and production rules to detect antimicrobial therapies at risk of failure M�ller  [] propose an   diagnostic knowledge base that can compete with commercial ones Replacing humans is another topic of research and Spnig  [] work on two aspects to virtualize a doctor the automatic acquisition of data through sensors and speech recognition and the automation of diagnostic reasoning Rozenblum et al[] propose a machine learning method to generate clinically valid alerts to detect errors in prescriptions Acceptability  of  CDSS  is  another  key point Kannan  [] propose a method for a CDSS design to best meet a precisely specified and assessable user purpose Design alerts  may  also  avoid  rejection  of  CDSSs by caregivers Fernandes  [] created algorithms able to aggregate filter and reduce the notifications delivered to healthcare professionals Amrose et  al [] tried to understand in real life the impact of alerts on users and to find the actions they triggered Finally it is always interesting to obtain varied evaluation results of controversial CDSSs In this respect Kim  [] evaluated Watson for Oncology in thyroid carcinoma and reported a concordance rate with local practices considered as too low to adopt the tool As  evidenced  by  the  number  and  the variety of works around decision support research in the field is

narrative and described in large textual documents the aim of this work was to model complex guidelines as datadriven clinical decision trees CDTs that could be still humaninterpretable while computerinterpretable for implementation in decision support systems The Dutch national breast cancer guidelines were translated into CDTs Data items  which  characterize  the  patient  and the tumor

grafting SV saphenous veins TF tissue factorA normal SV is composed of the intima the media and theadventitia8 The intima is built of the layer of endothelial cellson the luminal side the media consists of smooth musclecells and the adventitia forms the outer part8 In a normalsetting the endothelium is crucial for vein integrity andprevention of thrombosis9 and its focal disruption maypredispose to vessel thrombosis2 SV manipulation andimplantation leads to loss of endothelial integrity and elicitsan inﬂammatory response with platelet adhesion and leukocyte recruitment Notwithstanding an overt thrombosis isextremely rare in the operating room SV dissection results inblood ﬂow disruption in vasa vasorum and causes adventitial damage hypoxia and vessel wall hyponutrition10 Acuteperioperative saphenous vein graft failure is almost always aresult of graft thrombosis but this very uncommonly occursprior to graft placement Surgical factorslike technicalanastomotic failure or severe disproportion between thetarget vessel and the graft may lead to thrombosis butvessel injury and hypercoagulability are among potentialcauses as well11There was

our patient�s SVs the inﬂammatory background alone could not explain the dramatic intraoperativethrombosis We hypothesized that increased thrombin generation and prothrombotic ﬁbrin clot phenotype were responsiblefor the clinical presentation Conversion of ﬁbrinogen to ﬁbrinfacilitated by thrombin is a concluding step of coagulation Ithas been shown that ﬁbrin clots with small pores betweentightly packed thin ﬁbrin ﬁbers are relatively lysis resistant12Such clot phenotype has been evidenced in multiple thromboticpathologies such as myocardial infarction6 ischemic stroke13and venous thromboembolism4 The prothrombotic clotphenotype reﬂected by a tendency to form dense ﬁbrin clotsresistant to lysis has been previously reported in patients withinstent thrombosis14 While routine thrombophilia screeningresults in a high almost  detection rate of commonhypercoagulable states15 there are prothrombotic conditionsthat escape routine diagnostic approach The overall microscopic clot appearance and prothrombotic ﬁbrin properties lead tothe discovery of two mutations in our patient that are notroutinely tested during thrombophilia screening namely ﬁbrinogen 455G  A and FXIII100G  TElevated ﬁbrinogen was postulated as one of the riskfactors for early graft failure after CABG1116 Epidemiologicalstudies have established that elevated ﬁbrinogen is stronglyassociated with cardiovascular diseases17 A  metaanalysis of individual records of  participants from prospective studies revealed that age and sexadjustedhazard ratio per  gL increase in usual ﬁbrinogen level forcoronary heart disease was   conﬁdence interval [CI]� while for stroke the hazard ratio was as high as 95CI � Risk of coronary disease progression wasalso linked to genetic polymorphisms of the

of  studies with  patientsfound that A allele of the ﬁbrinogen 455G  A is associated with susceptibility to coronary disease and also withischemic stroke odds ratio for stroke �  [ CI �]for AA þ GA vs GG19 In a recent study of patients with atrialﬁbrillation Hu and colleagues found that the A allele of ﬁbrinogen 455G  A was a risk factor for cardioembolicstroke probably by elevating the level of plasma ﬁbrinogen20 On the other hand in a  metaanalysis of studies involving  cases and  controls FXIIIVal34Leu polymorphism was shown to be associated withrisk myocardial infarction21 FXIII is crucial to thrombusstabilization and changes of its plasma concentration reﬂectnonspeciﬁcally the extent of thrombosis as shown by Li et alin a study on patients with cerebral venous thrombosis22Interesting associations of FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism andthrombotic disorders have been reported Jung et al reportedin a metaanalysis of  studies that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss23Although no association with the incidence of ischemicstroke was found for this polymorphism24 apparentlywhen the stroke occurs Val34Leu polymorphism of FXIIIaffects the severity of its outcome25 Furthermore Kreutzand colleagues suggested in  that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism may increase risk of recurrent MI and death inpatients with angiographically established coronary arterydisease26 In  our group has shown in a study of patients that in patients undergoing CABG FXIII Leu34 alleleis associated with decreased ﬁbrin clot permeability andefﬁciency of ﬁbrinolysis27ConclusionOur extensive workup showed that ﬁbrinogen HaeIII andFXIII Val34Leu polymorphisms are reﬂected in reduced clotpermeability and susceptibility to lysis These mutationslikely contributed to intraoperative saphenous graft thrombosis Further studies are needed to elucidate the role ofthese polymorphisms in early graft failure after bypassgrafting procedures however their

serum levels MMP2and MMP9 were lower in the ﬁrst monthafter surgery compared with before surgerybut the difference was not signiﬁcant Thismight be because before ablationthetumor parenchyma induced the tumorstroma to produce larger amounts ofMMP2 and MMP9 which were releasedinto the blood These results suggest thatfailure to completely ablate the tumor ortumor recurrence may result in the secretionof high levels of MMP2 and MMP9 intothe blood However serum levels of MMP and MMP9 were signiﬁcantly decreasedat   and  months after surgery compared with before surgery suggesting thatserum

deposition of calcium salts at the tip of the nippleor the secretion of calcium salts by thetumor itself and has been considered tobe the most speciﬁc sign of PTC In thisstudy the incidence of

Moreover the relevantthyroid hormone analysis and other serumindicators could not be followed up for alonger periodtreating PTC FurthermoreIn summary the results of this studyshowed that RFA could

and accurate2526 RFA is considered an effectiveand safe treatment for control of BTNsIn most cases the incidence of haemorrhage and other complications is low20However haemorrhage is sometimes lifethreatening because serious haematomasmay compress the upper airways Manyreports have described active bleedingduring FNA of thyroid nodules and RFAof hepatocellular carcinomas14�� andsome reports have described fatalities14ThusimportantcomplicationhaemorrhageanisThree types of haemorrhage may occurperithyroidal subcapsular and intranodular121427� The mechanism of haemorrhage is thoughtto be related to themechanical or thermal injuries induced bythe RFA electrode tip3031 Thyroid nodulesreportedly have abundant capsular vesselsthat are usually anastomosed with vesselspenetrating into the core32 These numerousvessels are abnormal thinwalled and susceptible to rupture Large thyroid nodulesare another cause of haemorrhage becausemultiple insertions are often required totreat such nodules In additionthepatient cannot coordinate with the physician during the RFA procedure the perithyroidal orintrathyroidal vessels mayeasily be damaged by movement of theneedle tip or production of heat

are both essential Patient cooperationis the ﬁrst requirement When the needle tipis in the patient�s body any uncooperativemotion of the patient may lead to injury ofvessels or other structures Most patientscan endure the procedure under local anaesthesia however anxious patients mayrequire general anaesthesia to achieve cooperation If possible smallbore electrodesshould be chosen to decrease the risk ofbleeding35 It is necessary to cauterise thesupplying vasculature of nodules to avoidrecurrence and residue Howeverthepuncture route should be carefully designedto avoid pericapsular vessels and the electrode tip should be closely monitoredActive bleeding during needle puncture isvisible as a rapidly expanding hypoechoicor anechoic signal Locating the haemorrhagic focus is not difﬁcult with CEUSguidance The bleeding pointcan beblocked by RF electrode tip insertion anddirect ablation When the bleeding is toorapid to control with the RF electrode tipby increasing the power drug injection is asuitable alternative Lyophilised thrombin 0cHu et alpowder can be dissolved in normal salineand then injected at the bleeding pointthrough a syringe with US guidance Onereport also described haemorrhage treatedby local injection of hypertonic saline andepinephrine solution in a patient with hepatocarcinoma36 Mildbleeding whichappears as a hypoechoic layer can mostlybe controlled using ice and compression ofthe neck for several minutes after the procedure30 All bleeding can be controlled byconservative methodsthus no surgicalintervention is needed Ecchymosis can befound after the procedure and usually disappears in approximately  to  weeksPostprocedure CEUS is indispensablefor all patients regardless of whether bleeding occurs CEUS is an objective evaluationtool for active bleeding37 Close clinicalobservation for  hours postoperatively isrecommended in our department becausemost bleeding occurs during the ﬁrstlobectomy38Observation of the neck can help to detecta haematoma early and may aid in preventing serious adverse effectsthyroidhoursafterConclusionAcute thyroid bleeding is one possible complication of RFA although rare it is potentially lifethreatening Proper selection ofpatients and sufﬁcient preparation areessential During the RFA procedureboth an effective clinical strategy and adequate technical skills are indispensable Thephysician should trace the electrode tipusing realtime US and sufﬁciently managebleeding Mild bleeding has limited morbidity and can be easily controlled by compression Active bleeding tends to be rarehowever it may be disastrous if the operator is unaware or careless Direct ablationwith the RF electrode tip and drug injectioninto the bleeding focus are effective modalities for active bleeding CEUS and closeobservation are also recommended afterthe procedureto detect abnormalitiesearly RFA is an effective and relativelysafe alternative for selected patients withBTNs if performed by skilled

interesting toexplore whether the prosthesis materialinﬂuencesthepeak effect and the duration of the effectand if so what mechanisms affect the bonemicrostructure and whether there is a wayto change the outcome by blocking thiseffect during a 2year followup We currently have one option for prevention oravoidance of adverse events and thesechanges in treatment strategies may play akey role in improving the clinical resultsif the effects of the prosthesis materialitself cannot be blocked18 There is still alack of consensus on standards for prosthesis revision in this context19When assessing the impact of CTA onthe target events we did not observe anincreased incidence of severe orthopaediccomplications other than the complicationsmentioned in this study In one systematicreview the authors presumed that CTA wassuperior to UTA with respect to functionalscores and tolerable orthopaedic complications20 We obtained analogous results interms of hiprelated complications andfunctional scores Multicentre hip arthroplasty data indicate that UTA remains ahighrisk factor for late revision looseningand periprosthetic fractures810 The notabledissimilarities in the results of these variousstudies on hiprelated complications may belargely attributed to the design of the prosthesis prosthesis size and material selection and the surgeon�s experience46affected theThis study has several limitations It hada small sample and its retrospective designis association with some inherent disadvantages We did not stratify the patientsaccording to fracture type or sex In addition the potential comorbidities betweengroups were not well exposed and compared The statistical power used to addressdifferences between the groups was insufﬁcient Differences in the patients� baselinedata may haveresultsFurthermore our analysis did not determine whether the deaths were instigatedby bone cement The risk of hiprelatedcomplications was not analysed The survivalcurve of other prosthesisrelatedcomplications was estimated using theKaplan�Meier method and competitiverisks ie death could have affected thesurvival of the prosthesis Patients whodied lostrevisionHence the revision rate might have beenunderestimated during this long followupwith a fairly high mortality ratethe opportunity forevidenceIn conclusion the ﬁndings described inthe current review uphold an increasingbody ofthat CTA provideshigher functional scores and lower rates ofhiprelated complications than does UTAin elderly patients with osteoporotic displaced FNFs AOOTA 31BC In thiscontext we recommend CTA for the treatment of such FNFs Our ﬁndings may beconducive to alleviating continuing debateregarding which prosthesis UTA or CTAis more suitable for the elderly populationA future

portion of thestomach characterized by poor cellular differentiation and highintratumor heterogeneity This subtype has poorer outcomesdue to its widespread infiltration and invasive nature of thedisease78 Conversely within the United States the pathologyof GC is similar to that of malignancies found within the gastroesophageal junction8 Older patients are primarily impactedand the disease is commonly well differentiated intestinalThe welldifferentiated subtype is found in the cardia or lowerregion of the stomach with welldefined glandular structuresand growth pattern The WHO

markersincluding SOX17 hypermethylation BCL2 transforminggrowth factor beta TGFb vascular endothelial growth factorVEGFR and HER21418 Many of these proposed markersare studied extensively and do not serve as ideal targets dueto their limited clinical utility as either drug targets or predictors of therapeutic response Some examples of this include lesssuccessful attempts to target HER2 with monoclonal antibodiesand the use of TGFb inhibitors which although promisinghave proven to be highly toxic1920 Additionally these targetshave demonstrated limited clinical utility due to the crosstalkbetween TGFb and other signaling pathways such as RAS aknown nontargetable protein2122 While VEGF inhibitors areused as a therapeutic modality in GC they do not improveoverall survival23 An indepth investigation of the molecularmechanisms are urgently and investigations need to be distinctfrom the commonly studied and clinically intractable targetsAlthough this is the case discrepancies exist within the literature as some groups look at the molecular composition of GC asa whole while others focus on differences within the Laurenclassification systemUsing the Oncomine database we have found significantupregulation in several understudied genes in all GCs including COL3A1 COL5A2 SPON2 and CDH11 Table  Wealso have confirmed the upregulated status of many of thegenes found within the literature that are somewhat well knownsuch as INHBA a gene associated with poor overall outcomes24 but are still understudied Claudin  CLDN1 hasbeen found to be highly expressed in GC and is a poor predictive disease marker by mediating tumor necrosis factorainduced cell migration enhancement of proliferation andmetastasis while SULF1 has been found to be significantlyhypomethylated causing significant downregulated proteinexpression2528 This SULF1 downregulation may be indicativeof a posttranslational modification feedback loop or degradation event via protein�protein interactions but is still unclearNot surprisingly a significant underrepresentation was notedwhen comparing publications related to these genes over publications to the commonly studied genes such as MAPKPI3K and TP53

the vast heterogeneticmolecular landscape within the poorly differentiated diffusewell differentiated intestinal and mixed GC subtypesTable  Poorly differentiated GC shares many similaritieswith GC overall including perturbations in various collagentranscribing genes stimulation of PI3KAKT signaling andperturbations in cellular structural components This is a dominant subtype throughout the world for reasons we have previously mentioned Due to the overabundance of collagentranscribing genes we wanted to explore whether a potentialgenetic link exists Literature search identified a study correlating EhlersDanlos syndrome EDS a disease caused bycollagen gene perturbations to the development of GC29EhlersDanlos syndrome also presents with gastrointestinalinvolvement such as increased rates of heartburn which is arisk factor for developing esophageal cancer3031 Based on thelocation of these gastric tumors within the stomach that is inthe proximal stomach near the esophagus and the connectionbetween gastric and esophageal cancers it is quite possiblethere may be a much stronger correlation between EDS anddiffuse GC than previously thoughtWe have found GC overall does not share many molecularsimilarities with the welldifferentiated subtype of GC withinthe scope of our analysis We have found only a similarityCLDN1 expression Claudin  is a gene involved in coding forthe

distinctly different but we did find similarity with THY1expression both having similar fold changes Although thisgene has not been investigated in GC it is overexpressed inthe pancreatic cancer microenvironment35 Further investigation may be needed as this gene may have importance in GCdevelopmentWe finally investigated the mixed subtype of GC a subtypethat is commonly overlooked within the literature Table Interestingly mixed GC has some similarities to the diffusesubtype including PI3KAKT signaling a collagen transcribinggene and upregulation of cellular anizational

protectingtumors from 5flurouracil 5FUinduced death a chemotherapy commonly used to treat GC3738 It is likely the diffusesubtype is not the only subtype with a strong genetic link butthe mixed subtype may have a stronger genetic component thanpreviously thought We hypothesize some of the genetic diversity within GC is masked when analyzed as a whole whichfurther supports the notion of this disease being highlyheterogeneousGenetic Analysis of Downregulated GC GenesThere are about twice as many published studies looking atupregulated GC genes compared to downregulated  vs The most common

suggests that this subtype may be more sensitiveto platinum drugs56 This overall downregulation of metabolicpathways may also point to an increase in the Warburg effectThis alternative metabolic

note and be beneficial for nonintestinal like GCsbecause there is a clear trend of significant downregulation ofthis gene   fold differenceWe next assessed the molecular aberrations in the

rheumatoid arthritis6061 Again themixed subtype is molecularly different from the intestinal anddiffuse gastric subtypes based on this genetic pathway analysiswith notably less involvement of metabolism related genesAlthough this is expected due to its difference in subtypingthe mixed gastric subtype has a much smaller representationwithin the literature than the intestinal and diffuse types and itis clear that further investigation is needed A better understanding of the diverse nature of downregulated genes in allaspects of GC is needed as a first step to identify new therapeutic options that will benefit patients with GCGastric Cancer Exhibits High Molecular DifferencesBetween GendersWithin the United States men and women older than  are athigher risk for developing GC while the male population ishigher in risk for welldifferentiated GC development than thefemale population mainly due to the protective effect of estrogen against developing H pylori induced gastric carcinogenesis62 Females have higher incidence of poorly differentiatedGCs compared to their male counterparts for reasons largelyunknown Various environmental factors play a role in diseasedevelopment as a whole including obesity smoking drinkingand a poor diet6366 A retrospective study by Kim et al hasshown that women not only have a higher incidence of diffusetype GC but have a worse overall prognosis as well as geneticdifferences compared to men including ERb expression67 suggesting a hormonal component may also be a contributing factor to this subset of disease Due to the evident genderdisparities in GC we investigated the underlying moleculardifferences between male and female patients by preformingGEO2R analysis on the GSE118916 data set Our results showstriking differences in differentially expressed genes betweenmales and femalesOverall both male and female patients with GC showed anabundance of upregulated genes Figure 2A After stratifyingbased on gender the female patients with GC have a higherabundance of upregulated genes oncogenic like genes genes greater than 5fold upregulation compared to downregulated genes Figure 2B while male patients with GC have agreater abundance of downregulated genes tumor suppressorlike genes Figure 2B This trend can also be seen from just thetop differentially expressed genes in the provided tables Current treatment options for GC are somewhat limited in achieving a longterm survival benefit and we wanted to use ourcohorts to identify whether there are differences in actionabletargets between gendersFemale Patients With GC Are Vastly UnderrepresentedWithin Clinical StudiesWe found no direct druggable targets according to the DGIdbdatabase with the top differentially expressed genes Therefore we looked further into the individual protein�proteininteraction networks using STRING database Figure 2CFBroadening the scope of our search allowed us to find manypotential druggable targets Table  We narrowed the scopeof our search to inhibitorsantagonist type compounds due tothe substantial genes found to be upregulated Many of thedruggable targets such as estimated glomerular filtration rateEGFR tyrosine

metastatic GC68 Lapatinib aTKI responsible for inhibiting HER2neu and EGFR wastested in a phase III clinical trial TyTAN Trial in Asianpatients with GC69 There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival for Paclitaxel plus Lapatinib overPaclitaxel alone70 We looked further into the patient demographics of the TyTAN trial and noticed a large underrepresentation of female patients within all arms of the study total female patients Another example of this is a trial withBortezomib which interacts with the ADAM17 pathway andhas been tried unsuccessfully in Phase II clinical trials in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic patientswith GC71 As with the Lapatinib trial this one had an overrepresentation of male patients  compared to femalepatients  A common occurrence within many of theGC clinical trials is combination of new therapies with paclitaxel or some type of Taxol We have found the female cohortto have an abundance of druggable targets interact with paclitaxel including EPB41L4B and CAPN9 Table  but largelythis demographic is underrepresented within clinical trial studies It is clear that based on the molecular profile of femalepatients with GC this issue demands further investigationMale Patients With GC May Benefit From HormoneInhibiting TherapiesAs we have previously mentioned the male cohort has anopposite molecular profile compared to the female cohort withWhen screening for actionable drug targets we limited thescope of our analysis to agonists due to the substantial geneticdownregulation already occurring naturally and notion thatmale patients with GC have an abundance of tumor suppressorlike genes In doing so we have found direct druggable targetssuch as SSTR1 and GPT Table  GPT is a gene that encodesthe alanine aminotransaminase  protein and catalyzes thereversible transamination between alanine and 2oxoglutaratewithin the tricarboxylic acid TCA cycle to generate pyruvatea TCA

regress  They  are  aesthetically  disfiguring  can cause pain itching discomfort as well as psychological stress often affecting quality of life Many treatment modalities including surgical and nonsurgical have been explored and have been reported to be beneficial however none have been absolutely satisfactory or optimal for the treatment of all keloid subtypes to date This  poses  a  major

Healinginfluence  in  keloid  aetiology9  Although  no  one specific gene has been associated with the development of keloids a number of genes and gene loci have been identified610 Genomewide association studies and admixture mapping studies have identified singlenucleotide polymorphisms across certain loci genetically linked to keloid development including  the  NEDD4  gene  which  encodes  E3 ubiquitin  ligase  enzyme  and  the  myosin  genes MY01E and MYO7A10� Studies have also reported the involvement of several human leucocyte antigen HLA alleles p53 bcl2 and fas genes1014� Furthermore  rare  genetic  disorders  have  been reported  to  present  with  spontaneous  keloids including Dubowitz syndrome Bethlem myopathy RubinsteinTaybi  syndrome  Noonan  syndrome Geominne

and environmental factors Keloids form as a result of abnormal wound healing and excessive dermal fibrosis Development of keloids has been linked to overproliferation and reduced apoptosis of dermal fibroblasts overproduction of collagen fibres and other extracellular matrix ECM components as well as abnormal ECM production and remodelling1  Various  cytokines  growth  factors and proteolytic enzymes have been implicated in the  formation  of  keloids  including  transforming growth factor TGF epidermal growth factor EGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF plateletderived growth factor PDGF connective tissue  growth  factor  CTGF  tumour  necrosis factorα  TNFα insulinlike  growth  factor1  IGF1 fibroblast growth factor FGF interleukin6  IL6  and  matrix  metalloproteinases

keloidsHistologically keloids comprise an abundance of unordered  dermal  collagen  and  vasculature  with high  inflammatorycell  infiltrate  and  overactive mesenchymal  cells1415  In  addition  to  collagen elastin  fibronectin  and  proteoglycans  are  deposited in excess amounts in keloid scars9 Collagen creates  frequent  crosslinks  in  ordinary  wounds whereas collagen is irregularly anised in keloids forming nodules in the dermis20 During normal Figure   Earlobe keloids as a consequence of ear piercingarise from skin trauma or inflammation and may develop  years  after  the  initial  insult  and  rarely regress2 The scar tissue extends beyond the original wound site and can be disfiguring and cause psychosocial  issues  impairing  quality  of  life3  In addition  patients  may  present  with  symptoms such as burning pain pruritus movement limitation and hyperaesthesia2AetiologyThe  aetiology  of  keloids  is  still  poorly  understood The most common regions of the skin for keloids include upper arms skin overlying joints chest shoulders and head�neck regions particularly  the  ear  lobes  Figure    The  anatomical location of a keloid appears to alter its morphological characteristics Some keloids can develop spontaneously  however  most  occur  years  after local trauma and other events including inflammation surgery burns elective cosmesis foreign body reactions acne insect bites vaccinations or mechanical force45Epidemiology and keloid geneticsThe incidence of keloids is highest among darkerpigmented  persons  of  African  Asian  and Hispanic  descent  and  is  estimated  to  be  in  the range  of  �  Males  and  females  have  an equal risk of developing keloids6 although incidence  is  slightly  increased  in  females  likely attributable to them having more cosmetic procedures  like  ear  piercing7  Persons  aged  � years  are  also  at  a  higher  risk  of  developing keloids  Additional  risk  factors  include  having blood  type  A  hyperIgE  and  hormonal  peaks during pregnancy or puberty8Familial  keloid  case  studies  and  twin  studies support  the  notion  that  genetic  factors  have  an 0cOjeh  for the treatment of

Corticosteroids  have  antiinflammatory  and  antimitotic  properties1  Several  other mechanisms  have  been  reported  by  which  corticosteroids reduce keloid scar including inhibition of  fibroblast  growth  attenuation  of  procollagen and  glycosaminoglycan  synthesis  reduction  of endothelial  budding  and  enhancement  of  collagen  and  fibroblast  degeneration2829  Corticos teroids  inhibit  TGF1  expression  and  induce apoptosis in fibroblasts inhibit VEGF and alphaglobulins which are involved in the wound healing  process28�  VEGF  which  promotes angiogenesis was reported to be highly expressed in  keloid  fibroblasts  compared  to  controls  but exogenous  addition  of  the  glucocorticoid  dexamethasone  suppressed  its  expression  in  vitro32 Furthermore VEGF expression was overexpressed in  keloid  tissue  which  later  reduced  following intralesional TAC injections in vivo33TAC  is  typically  administered  at  intervals  of �  weeks  until  pruritic  and  painassociated symptoms  diminish  and  the  scar  flattens34  The dose  of  TAC  is  in  the  range  of  �  mgmL depending  on  the  size  and  anatomical  location of the lesion and the age of the patient34 TAC is used either alone as a monotherapy or in combination  with  other  treatment  modalities13  The response  rates  to  corticosteroid  injections  vary clinically  with  regression  rates  in  the  range  of �  reported  after  one  year  and  recurrence  rates  in  the  range  of  �  reported after  five  years3  Combined  therapy  comprising surgical excision followed by TAC treatment also varied  with  reported  recurrence  rates  in  the range  of  �  Previous  clinical  studies where TAC was used alone reported efficacy and good  clinical  outcome  with  this  treatment  including reduced keloid height length width related pruritus and erythema and improved pliability3637  A  recent  randomised  parallelgroup study  that  compared  the  role  of  intralesional TAC  fractional  CO2  laser  or  intralesional  verapamil  in  the  treatment  of  keloid  in    patients showed reduction in scar height vascularity and pliability in all three groups using the Vancouver Scar Scale score however pigmentation was not completely resolved with any of the treatments The  response  was  fastest  with  TAC  followed  by verapamil and laser and this was statistically significant38 However intralesional TAC in combination with other treatment modalities such as 5fluorouracil  5FU  pulsed  dye  laser  PDL surgery  interferon  IFNα2b  verapamil  and

age of patient52 These include linear closure and flap  coverage  excision  with  grafting  Wplasty and  Zplasty53  To  reduce  risk  of  keloid  recurrence  the  surgeon  performing  the  excision should establish tensionfree wound closure As a general  rule  closure  of  the  wound  should  be accomplished with minimal tension and sutures leaving everted wound borders Zplasties threelayered  sutures  subcutaneousfascial  tensile reduction  sutures  or  local  ﬂap  surgery  can  be employed  on  a  casebycase  basis5455  The  final outcome of the scar is often positively correlated with  the  experience  of  the  operating  surgeon and  technique  utilised  as  well  as  the  patients� active participation in their wound care52Siliconebased productsSince  the  1980s  siliconebased  products  have been used in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic  scars  with  silicone  gel  or  silicone  gel sheeting  considered  as  firstline  therapy  for minor keloids and hypertrophic scars2635 There are  various  other  forms  of  silicone  including creams sprays gel cushion and liquid24 The precise mechanism of action of silicone products is not fully understood but it is proposed that they enhance hydration and create an occlusive environment53 which influences fibroblast regulation and  decreases  collagen  synthesis56  Silicone  gel sheeting  has  been  shown  to  have  minimal  side effects  including  local  irritation  which  can  be resolved  quickly24  Studies  have  shown  that  the beneficial  effects  of  silicone  gel  sheets  include pain reduction tenderness and pruritus and flattening the keloid57 The silicone gel sheeting is recommended to be worn from two weeks after primary  wound  treatment  for  �  h  for  � months58Studies have demonstrated an improvement of up to  in keloid scars after using silicone gel  sheeting35  and  a  decrease  in  the  incidence rates  of  keloids  and  hypertrophic  scars  after  surgery59  In  addition  controlled  studies  have reported the clinical effectiveness of silicone gel and silicone gel sheeting in the prevention and treatment of keloids3558 However a recent metaanalysis  review60  and  Cochrane  review61  found that even though studies published data in support of the efficacy of silicone gel sheeting in the treatment  and  prevention  of  keloid  and  hypertrophic  scarring  they  provided  weak  evidence and  were  of  poor  quality60�  Therefore  given Figure   Auricular keloid surgical excision used as monotherapy Auricular keloid before a and after b surgical excisonsurgery all yielded significant improvements compared to treatment with TAC monotherapy339�Intralesional  steroid  injections  can  cause  several  adverse  side  effects  such  as  telangiectasis atrophy steroid acne pigmentary changes necrosis ulcerations and systemic side effects3 There is also  significant  pain  associated  with  intradermal corticosteroid injections that can be reduced when local anaesthetic lidocaine is administered to control the pain44 Furthermore the side effects have been reported to diminish when intralesional TAC is used in combination with 5FU45Surgical excisionSurgical excision is a traditional method of removing keloids Figure  However excision creates a new wound and can result in a similar or larger keloid47  Therefore  surgical  excision  is  not  recommended as a monotherapy as it results in high recurrence  rates  in  the  range  of  � For better postoperative surgical outcomes surgical excision is often combined with other forms of treatment  including  radiotherapy  intralesional corticosteroid  injections  IFN  injection  bleomycin cryotherapy pressure therapy and silicone gel or sheeting82649 Successful use of dermal substitutes and epidermal skin grafting with keloid excision has also been reported50 A recent case series study  in  which    patients  with  anterior  chest wall keloids were given a treatment protocol consisting  of  complete  excision  Zplasty  postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and postsurgical wound selfmanagement  reported  excellent  outcomes with a recurrence rate of only  The use of steroid tape and injections helped to resolve the recurrence of keloids51 0cOjeh  the  lack  of  substantial  evidence  welldesigned clinical trials and studies are required to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of siliconebased products in preventing and treating keloidsPressure therapyPressure therapy has been used to treat and manage keloids and hypertrophic scars for decades3563 It has been routinely employed as firstline treatment  in  the  treatment  of  hypertrophic  scarring resulting  from  burns64  The  underlying  mechanisms of action of compression techniques remain unclear however several hypotheses exist some of which include increased pressure to the scar surface  reduces  perfusion  and  decreased  oxygen  to the location of injury reduces collagen synthesis It is  also  thought  that  pressure  increases  apoptosis reduces  scar  hydration  stabilising  mast  cells  and decreases angiogenesis165 The application of pressure can be achieved using a variety of materials such as adhesive plaster moulds pressure earrings and  customfitted  splints16  which  have  improved scar cosmesis and rates of keloid recurrence66� A continuous  pressure  of  �  mmHg  preferably at the lower range soon after wound reepithelialisation for � h per day for   months is recommended166869 The efficacy of pressure therapy depends mainly on the anatomical location of the scar with trunk and limb areas being more appropriate  sites  for  pressure  therapy  In  addition  a pressure garment is predominantly used for auricular  keloids  where  pressure  clips  are  commonly utilised  after  surgery6670  As  an  adjuvant  therapy this form of pressure garment has also been successfully  used  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of keloids6667 In contrast a metaanalysis review that analysed  the  effectiveness  of  pressure  garment therapy  for  the  prevention  of  abnormal  scarring after  burn  injury  was  unable  to  demonstrate  any beneficial effects of pressure garment therapy on prevention  or  treatment  of  abnormal  scarring59 Notwithstanding success rates of pressure therapy are contingent upon patient compliance69 which can sometimes be low due to discomfort Overall pressure therapy is tolerated better and is devoid of the pain often associated with intralesional therapies and hence can be considered as a good adjuvant therapy for keloid scarsRadiotherapyIn  the treatment of keloids using superficial Xray irradiation was first described71 Since then it has been used less frequently as a monotherapy and more widely as an effective adjunct treatment after surgical excision72� with success rates in the range  of  �  and  recurrence  rates  of about  Radioactive skin patches have also been used in combination with other treatment modalities  for  keloids7879  Radiotherapy  is  most commonly used � h after surgical excision7480 and acts by suppressing angiogenesis and inhibiting ﬁbroblast activity1 Decreased fibroblast proliferation  induced  cell  senescence  and  apoptosis leading to reduction in collagen production and suppression  of  keloid  development  have  also been reported81�Different  radiotherapy  modalities  have been  used  after  surgical  excision  including electron  beam  radiotherapy  brachytherapy superﬁcial and orthovoltage radiotherapy with varying  degrees  of  success84  Mankowski  et a0 al conducted  a  literature  review  of    studies  to compare  the  clinical  outcome  of  different forms of radiation treatment used for the management of keloids77 The metaanalysis demonstrated  that  radiation  used  as  monotherapy yielded higher rates of recurrence  compared  to  combinational  therapy  with  postsurgery excision  Comparison between the different  radiationbased  treatments  revealed that the lowest rate of recurrence was observed with  brachytherapy    followed  jointly  by Xray    and  electron  beam    The authors  also  reported  that  the  rate  of  recurrence was dependent on anatomical site of the keloid  with  chest  keloids  having  the  highest recurrence rate73The  adverse  effects  of  radiotherapy  often linked  with  dose  of  radiation  used  can  be grouped into acute skin reactions and late complications Acute reactions arise as early as seven days after keloid treatment and include oedema necrosis  ulceration  desquamation  erythema and  pigmentary  changes  with  the  latter  two being  the  most  common  Late  complications which include changes in pigment atrophy telangiectasis  and  alopecia  may  present  several weeks after radiotherapy Emollient and steroid ointment used after radiotherapy can help alleviate the side effects19 A recommended radiation dose   Gy over several sessions can also minimise  adverse  effects1980  Radiotherapy  carries  a risk of malignancy8586 Therefore caution should be used in radiationvulnerable sites such as the head  neck  thyroid  and  breast  and  in  patients aged   years2 Protecting fragile ans and selecting  the  most  appropriate  sitedependent dose protocol can help minimise further complications of radiotherapy87 0c Scars Burns  HealingCryotherapyCryotherapy is a lowtemperature treatment that causes  vascular  damage  resulting in  tissue  necrosis88 It has been used to treat keloids as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment  methods  such  as  intralesional  steroid  injections89  Various  delivery  methods  used  for cryotherapy include spray and contact probes or the intralesionalneedle  cryoprobe  method Compared to contact and spray methods intralesionalneedle  cryoprobe  was  found  to  be  the most effective method in treating keloid scars90 Positive outcomes were observed in a number of studies  that  used  liquid  nitrogen  and  cryotherapy to treat keloids with success rates in the range of ��External  cryotherapy  has  been  associated with several side effects including hypopigmentation  blistering  pain  delayed  healing  and  infection9093 Moreover larger keloids have been shown to need multiple cryotherapy sessions9093 To  minimise  side  effects  intralesional  cryotherapy was introduced and there are now a number of  nitrogenbased  cryodevices  that  have  been described for the treatment of keloid scars with two  commercially  available  a  liquid  nitrogenbased device88 and an argon gasbased device94 The  intralesional  cryotherapy  was  designed  to overcome the hypopigmentation seen mostly in darkskinned individuals with external cryotherapy It works by destroying the core of the keloid sparing the surface epithelial cells including melanocytes9596  As  a  result  it  enhances  volume decrease  while  minimising  the  risk  of  hypopigmentation and other surface reactions90 A recent comprehensive  review  based  on  the  preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalysis was performed to investigate the efficacy of  intralesional  cryotherapy  on  keloid  scars90 The review of eight studies that met the inclusion criteria  revealed  that  average  scar  volume decreased  in  the  range  of  �  but  complete eradication of the scar on average was lacking Recurrence of keloid scars was in the range of  �  The  authors  also  reported  that patients�  complaints  of  pain  and  pruritus  was considerably  reduced  however  hypopigmentation was seen mostly in Fitzpatrick � skin type patients after treatment90Laser therapyLaser  therapy  for  keloid  treatment  was  introduced in the 1980s97 Since then different systems have been used for the treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars4898 These lasers target skin chromophores like haemoglobin and melanin based on the principle of selective photothermolysis99  Lasers  can  be  classified  as ablative  and  nonablative  The  most  common ablative  lasers  include  the  2940nm  erbiumdoped  yttrium  aluminium  garnet  ErYAG laser and the 10600nm carbon dioxide CO2 laser These emit a laser beam that is absorbed by  water  in  the  skin  leading  to  local  tissue destruction  and  reduction  of  lesion  volume3 Common  examples  of  nonablative lasers include 585nm or 595nm PDLs 1064nm neodymiumdopedyttriumaluminiumgarnet NdYAG neodymiumdopedvanadate  NdVan  laser  and    nm Qswitched  NdYAG  laser  with  low  fluence100 These lasers induce thermal injury to the scar�s microvasculature  leading  to  thrombosis  and ischaemia  which  result  in  collagen  denaturation and collagen fibre realignment101�532nm laser Laser  therapy  requires  several  treatments  at intervals of � weeks depending on scar type and type  of  laser  used98104  with  possible  side  effects including itching pigmentary changes blister formation  and  postoperative  purpura98  The  use  of the  nonfractional  vascular  �  nm  PDL  in the  treatment  of  keloid  and  hypertrophic  scars has been welldocumented105� and has response rates in the range of � PDL monotherapy has been shown to be effective108110 as well as CO2 laser monotherapy38111112 In a clinical study where  patients with moderate to severe keloids were  treated  with  highenergy  pulsed  CO2  laser the  treatment  was  efficacious  and  welltolerated with minimal side effects112 In other studies where CO2 laser ablation was compared with other forms of treatment CO2 laser was as efficient as the other forms38111 It must be noted however that these studies are small and randomised controlled studies are lacking98Laser therapy such as PDL CO2 and NdYAG have  been  associated  with  a  high  rate  of  recurrence at � months111113� However optimal results  can  be  achieved  with  combination  treatment  especially  with  intralesional  TAC  injections116�  Kumar  and  coworkers  conducted  a cohort  study  on    patients  with  keloids  previously treated with an NdYAG laser and reported complete scar resolution and flattening in seven patients  only  when  intralesional  TAC  was  used after  laser  therapy41  Moreover  combined  therapy  with  PDL  and  TAC119  and  PDL  TAC  and 5FU36  were  shown  to  produce  better  clinical results In a recent study that evaluated and compared  the  efficacy  of  combination  therapy  of 0cOjeh  scars statistically fractional CO2 laser and intralesional TAC injection or TAC injection

safetyRecently  lasers  are  also  being  explored  as tools for assisted drug delivery Kraeva et a0al proposed an alternative technique of corticosteroid administration  of  laserassisted  drug  delivery  of topical TAC This was shown to be effective when used  on  a  keloid  on  the  posterior  scalp  of  a patient after each CO2 laser session122 More efficient  intraepidermal  drug  delivery  options  are also being investigated Singhal et a0al developed TACcontaining  polymeric  microps  that were prepared using a cryomilling technique for freezing fracture After ablation with a fractional ErYAG laser these microps can be deposited in cutaneous micropores and provide highdose intraepidermal  reservoir  systems  with minimal transdermal permeation leading to sustained and

predominantly  involve established virological procedures such as nucleic acid hybridization techniques reversetranscriptase PCR [RTPCR] and recombinase  polymerase  amplification  RPA  as  well  as immunologic  approaches like  antibody  assays  Each approach  boasts  unique  strengths  and  weaknesses  For instance while RTPCR demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity  its  capabilities  have  been  severely  limited  for practical reasons during this current pandemic due to global shortages of skilled personnel reagents and equipment and a processing time of up to  days By contrast immunologic tests such as antibody assays are rapid and require minimal equipment  but  they  have  limited  utility  in  the  context  of acute diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infections This is because it can take several days to weeks following symptom onset for a patient to mount a detectable antibody response6Immunological tools in research include enzymelinked immunosorbent  assays  ELISAs  flow  cytometry  and mass cytometry CyTOF Imaging techniques for pathological analyses include conventional approaches such as hematoxylin�eosin HE staining immunohistochemical IHC  staining  or  transmission  electron  microscopy TEM and RNAscope Each of these methods is used to examine the pathophysiology underlying COVID19 from a different perspective each with their own advantages and disadvantages  For  example  it  has  been  established  that the entry of SARSCoV2 intro cells depends on the binding of viral proteins with the human receptor angiotensinconverting  enzyme    ACE2  receptors7  Additionally evidence  shows  that  the  type  II  transmembrane  protease TMPRSS2 is also essential for viral entry by priming the viral spike protein for binding to ACE28 Therefore considerable  research  efforts  employing  different  techniques have  been  directed  at  mapping  the  distribution  of ACE2 and  TMPRSS2  in  tissues  and  their  relationship  to  the observed manifestations of disease Together the combination of these approaches has advanced our understanding of COVID19In  this  review  we  discuss  the  current  approaches  in COVID19 diagnosis and

of  the  disease processDiagnosticsThe most common symptoms of COVID19 at initial presentation  are  nonspecific  and  include  a  high  fever  a  new and  persistent  cough  and  fatigue910  Due  to  similarities between the clinical characteristics of COVID19 and many other respiratory illnesses the accurate and early detection of infection is pivotal for outbreak control Any delays in diagnosis

assays  and  pointofcare  detection11  The  intermediateterm priority would be their integration into multiplex diagnostic  platforms  while  the  longterm  goal  would  be  the investigation of prognostic markersIn this section we summarize the current and emerging diagnostic  tools  for  SARSCoV2  through  the  lens  of immunologyLabBased TestsRTPCR  Molecular  Testing  The  detection  of  viral  nucleic acids by RTPCR is the primary method used to confirm a suspected  case  of  COVID19  RTPCR  and  other  nucleic acid hybridization techniques are an integral part of virology and are applied in a broad range of settings including screening  diagnosis  informing  medical  and  therapeutic decisions and assessing cure rates from therapy12 Chinese officials released the genomic sequence of SARSCoV2 to public databases early in the course of the outbreak13 and the WHO has since published seven protocols for RTPCRbased diagnostics Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of RTPCR it is regarded as the �gold standard� for virus detection14 There are two essential steps in the process  viral RNA extraction and  PCR amplification and  probebased  detection  Multiple  largescale  highthroughput  instruments  are  available  for  automating  both steps such as the Roche Cobas  system which has an advertised throughput of  tests per  hours15However RTPCRbased testing is costly and timeconsuming requiring up to  days using centralized laboratory equipment and skilled personnel furthermore global supply  chain  challenges  have  led  to  significant  shortages  of essential reagents Lastly falsenegative results due to low sample  volumes  variable  sampling  techniques  and  sampling  locations  sample  degradation  during  transportation andor improper nucleic acid extraction are a concern16� In  addition  the  differences  in  detectable  viral  material  in different sampling locations eg nasopharyngeal vs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF] vs rectal samples might also  explain  the  falsepositive  RTPCR  results  on  repeat testing  in  �recovered�  COVID19  patients  Indeed  one postmortem case study revealed residual virus in lung tissue despite  consecutive  negative  results  on  PCR  testing  from nasopharyngeal  swabs19  Separately  Winichakoon  et  al outlined a case of repeatedly negative nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal  swabs  in  a  clinically  deteriorating  patient where only a BALF PCR test returned positive20Given the high expression of ACE2 on alveolar epithelial cells and negative expression on nasal oral and nasopharynx  0cTan et al cells21  it  would  be  prudent  to  perform  bronchoalveolar lavage  on  patients  to  rule  out  falsenegative  results  from swabs of upper respiratory tract samples20LabBased  Immunological  Assays  In  contrast  to  RTPCR techniques  that  detect  viral  nucleic  acids  serological  and immunological  assays  aim  to  detect  antibodies  against SARSCoV2 or antigenic proteins in infected individuals Neutralization assays are considered the gold standard for assessing  neutralizing  protective  antibodies22  however these  assays  require  specialized  biosafety  level    BSL3 facilities  and  still  take  several  days  to  complete Another type of labbased antibody assay is the traditional ELISA which  detects  all  binding  antibodies  The  four  principal types of ELISA are direct indirect competitive and sandwich  ELISA  the  indirect  ELISA  is  the  most  common method  for  determining  antibody  concentrations  ELISAs have  good  concordance  with  neutralization  assays  for  the detection of antibody responses in SARSCoV223 Unfortunately  both  methods  require  skilled  operators  and  are limited by low throughput due to the absence of fully automated systemsSerological  diagnostics  offer  several  advantages  Re quirements  for  specimen  quality  are  comparatively  less stringent  than  for  nucleic  acid  tests  as  the  antibodies  are uniformly  distributed  in  the  serum24  Consequently  sampling  location  concerns  do  not  apply  here  Furthermore good correlation between IgG ELISAs performed on both conventional serum samples and plasma samples have been reported25 of which the latter may be conveniently obtained from residual blood submitted for other routine laboratory testsOne pitfall of antibody assays is their limited utility early in the course of any infection Sparse data are available with regard to the antibody responses produced by patients with COVID19 It seems that SARSCoV2 IgM is detectable at a  median  of    days  after  symptom  onset  while  IgG  is detectable  after    days26  with  the  seroconversion  rate approaching    by  day    An  Italian  research  group noted  that  the  performance  of  a  commercial  VivaDiag COVID19 IgMIgG test was very poor with a sensitivity of only  and a negative predictive value of  in a cohort of suspected COVID19 patients in the emergency room setting27 As such we believe that for now RTPCR testing  is  likely  more  appropriate  for  diagnosing  acute COVID19Notably  a  longitudinal  study  examining  the  IgGIgM profiles  of    patients  found  that  seroconversion  for  IgG and IgM occurred in no specific chronological order with a median  of    days  after  symptom  onset28  all  patients achieved  seroconversion  by  day    Consequently  the detection of both IgG and IgM simultaneously rather than one antibody alone would be idealAnother  concern  surrounding  serologic  diagnostics  is the production of falsepositive results from crossreactivity due to the high prevalence of the four endemic human coronaviruses  in  the  human  population  In  SARSCoV2 the spike S protein which includes two regions S1 and S2  and  the  nucleocapsid  N  protein  NP  are  the  major immunogens29 and therefore most diagnostics rely on the detection  of  antibodies  specific  for  these  antigens  One work  suggests  that  of  the  possible  targets  the  S1  subunit antigen is more specific than either the whole S antigen or the N antigen for detecting SARSCoV2 antibodies with no crossreactivity to other coronaviruses except for SARSCoV23  Given  that  only    SARSCoV  infections  were recorded worldwide30 the risk of false positives from this crossreactivity  is  miniscule  However  NP  ELISAs  are more sensitive than S1 in detecting antibodies in those with a mild infection23 Importantly as in SARSCoV most of the neutralizing antibodies are directed against the S protein31  of  which  S1  contains  a  receptorbinding  domain RBD responsible for making contact with ACE2 to facilitate  viral  entry7  Thus  theoretically  only  diagnostics  that detect S1specific antibodies are suitable to infer immunity to  COVID19  this  fact  is  corroborated  by  evidence  that antiS RBD but not antiNP IgG levels correlated with neutralizing antibody titers in sera from a cohort of  recovered patients32 The number of commercial antibody assays is  growing  detecting  either  antiNP  antibodies  antiS1S antibodies  or  both  there  is  also  large  variation  in  their claimed sensitivities and specificities33 Based on the available evidence an ideal serological assay would be a combined test that simultaneously detects both antibodies to NP and S1 antigens assessment of antiNP antibodies has good sensitivity and would be best suited for supporting the diagnosis  of  infection  while  the  additional  antiS1  antibody assay would allow for the determination of immunityRapid TestsPointofCare RTPCR Tests  A small number of commercial pointofcare tests utilizing RTPCR have been developed These typically involve the same methodology as conventional RTPCR but implemented with automated and portable  benchtopsized  instruments  that  can  be  operated closer  to  patient  care  settings  than  a  centralized  laboratory  A  prominent  example  is  Cepheid�s  Xpert  Xpress SARSCoV2 run on the Gene Xpert platform This apparatus can provide a result within  min Others include the MesaBioTech Accula Test and MicrosensDx RapiPrep COVID19 Despite displaying good sensitivity and specificity  these  instruments  are  generally  limited  by  a  very low  throughput  of  only  one  to  four  tests  per  run  per machine34 and as such are only suited to small laboratories or clinics 0c SLAS Technology  Figure   Loopmediated isothermal amplification LAMP A LAMP begins when the forward inner primer FIP binds to the A2C region

immunoassays LFIAs Fig  and chemiluminescent immunoassays CLIAs Fig  offer the benefits of rapid diagnostic testing at a low cost These assays do not require specialized equipment or expertise35 and are thus excellent candidates for  pointofcare  testing  or  deployment  on  a  large  scale This an area of intense interest with governments worldwide  aiming  to  order  millions  of  tests  to  inform  policy makers about attack rates in their populations36 LFIAs are predominantly  singleuse  kits  designed  for  pointofcare use while CLIAs are fully automated analyzers that permit very high testing throughputUnfortunately  these  tests  do  not  quantify  the  antibody titers  and  the  performance  of  LFIAs  has  been  called  into question one evaluation of nine commercial LFIAs reported a sensitivity ranging from only  to  versus RTPCR and    to    versus  ELISA37  Meanwhile  the  performance of CLIAs is superior with good sensitivity and specificity levels similar to those of ELISA38 Otherwise these tests  share  the  same  advantages  and  drawbacks  as  the  0cTan et al Table   Summary of Diagnostic Approaches for COVID19CategoryType of TestTypical Test Result

Assays  An alternative approach to immunological assays is to directly detect SARSCoV2 viral antigens Several  commercial  pointofcare  antigen  tests  are  available but their performance remains to be evaluated These tests may be suitable for making an early diagnosis and are deployable as pointofcare assays However they face the same  sampling  limitations  as  RTPCR  and  are  hypothetically hampered by limited sensitivity due to the omission of  an  amplification  process  unlike  nucleic  acid  testing For  example  one  multicenter  study  evaluating  the  Corisbio COVID19 Ag RespiStrip a lateral flow assay for the SARSCoV2 NP reported a test sensitivity of only Rapid  NonPCR  Molecular  Testing  Nucleic  acid  testing using nonPCR methods is an emerging approach for rapid diagnostics  and  several  assays  have  received  Food  and Drug Administration FDA emergency use authorization which  facilitates  the  distribution  of  unapproved  medical products or the offlabel use of approved medical products  when  certain  criteria  are  met  These  methods  share high sensitivity and specificity on par with RTPCR but with  the  principal  advantages  of  more  rapid  testing  at  a lower cost40�LAMP Fig  is one such novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that does not require a thermal cycler One example is the ID NOW COVID19 test from Abbott Diagnostics which can deliver results in just  min43 and uses  a  lightweight  portable  instrument  allowing  onsite testing of swab samples However it has a limited throughput of only one sample per runThe CRISPR enzymes Cas12 and Cas13 have also been adapted  for  rapid  nucleic  acid  sensing    Fig    The DETECTR  assay  by  Mammoth  Biosciences45  as  well  as the  SHERLOCK  assay  by  Sherlock  Biosciences46  potentially offers sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of RTPCR but can be completed in  h However these approaches are still in the early stages of commercialization and current applications are available only as test kits to be run in labs while pointofcare versions exist as proofofconcept demonstrations47 Nonetheless their inherent characteristics hold great potential for diagnosis in the futurePrognostication of DiseaseProfiling  of  Genetic  Susceptibility  Work  is  in  progress  to ascertain the possible genetic basis for

the control lineSerum Prognostic Markers  Another application of immunological methods would be to measure markers that enable prognostication  in  COVID19  Higher  titers  of  antibodies against  SARSCoV2  have  been  associated  with  more severe  disease2350  similar  to  previous  studies  in  Middle East  respiratory  syndrome  MERS�CoV51  ELISA  has been used to provide a quantitative measurement of serum and  plasma  IgM  and  IgG  antibodies  By  monitoring  the kinetics of IgM and IgG antibodies specific to the N and S proteins on SARSCoV2 it was found that intensive care unit ICU patients had a significantly lower level of SIgG within    weeks  of  symptom  onset  but  a  higher  level  of NIgG antibodies compared with nonICU patients52 This finding highlights the possible utility of SIgG and NIgG as a prognostic tool for COVID19 patientsThe Ddimer level which consists of crosslinked fibrin degradation products that reflect ongoing blood clot formation  and  breakdown  activity  in  the  body  is  another  proposed  prognostic  marker  Modern  commercial  assays  for Ddimers are based on monoclonal antibodies employing either ELISA or microlatex agglutination assays53 Reports have emerged that elevated Ddimer levels suggestive of a hypercoagulable state are associated with drastically worse outcomes A Chinese group reported that Ddimer levels of ��  �gmL  on  admission  were  associated  with  a   times  increased  mortality  relative  to  Ddimer  levels  of   �gmL in a cohort of  COVID19 patients54 This finding of Ddimer levels as a negative prognostic marker was also noted in other studies conducted in China455 and the Netherlands56Similarly  interleukin  IL6  a  key  component  of  the cytokine release syndrome is another marker measured by ELISA  and  has  been  described  to  independently  predict adverse outcomes in COVID195758 Tumor necrosis factor alpha  TNFα  another  important  proinflammatory  cytokine  has  also  been  found  to  be  strongly  correlated  with Figure   Chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay CLIA SARSCoV2 antigens will capture IgM and IgG antibodies from the sample serum Secondary antibodies that are conjugated with horseradish peroxidase HRP bind to the captured primary IgM and IgG antibodies and react with a chemiluminescent substrate to generate a strong chemiluminescent signal that is measured in terms of relative light units RLUEast  Asian  populations  but  reported  no  direct  evidence supporting  the  existence  of  S  proteinbindingresistant ACE2 mutants48 out of  identified protein altering variants Separately Stawiski et al analyzed ACE2 polymorphisms  within  a  much  larger  population  dataset  spanning more than  population groups across the world and performed structural predictions to identify variants that might confer protection or rather increase susceptibility to SARSCoV2 S protein binding49 Out of a total of  identified proteinaltering ACE2 variants  variants were predicted to increase susceptibility while  variants were speculated to  confer  protection  however  the  degree  of  changes  in receptor�virus binding interactions for each structural variant was not quantified These findings represent significant developments in our understanding of population risk profiles for COVID19 and future coronavirus infections 0cTan et al endan  damage  and  mortality  even  after  adjusting  for disease severity scores59 Gao et al examined both IL6 and Ddimer levels they proposed a panel comprising tandem testing of these two markers which produced a sensitivity of    and  specificity  of    in  early  prediction  of severe COVID1958 Elevated troponin levels a marker of myocardial  injury  measured  with  ELISA  immunoassays also strongly predict progression to death in patients with severe illness60 These results suggest that multiplex cytokine and serum marker profiling will be a powerful tool in stratifying  patients  that  may  guide  clinical  decisions  and resource allocationSummary  In sum rapid progress has been made in diagnostics for COVID19 Yet the race against time continues for researchers and biotechnology firms to develop rapid costeffective  and  reliable  test  kits  that  can  be  deployed on a large scale At the time of writing labbased RTPCR testing  has  been  the  dominant  diagnostic  approach  but alternative molecular approaches like isothermal amplification and CRISPR which have clear advantages are on the horizon Immunological tests such as CLIA and LFIA will become increasingly important because of the urgent need for  pointofcare  diagnostics  for  mass  testing  of  infected asymptomatic individuals and their close contacts and will be  valuable  in  complementing  molecular  approaches  for confirming  infection  Furthermore  immunological  assays will  be  in  great  demand  by  policy  makers  worldwide  for the  assessment  of  immunity  to  COVID19  However  the performance of these serological tests varies significantly particularly  their  degree  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  we believe that caution must be taken in the interpretation of these tests Detailed evaluation of the reliability of serological tests will be a key area for future research Lastly given the  importance  of  techniques  like  ELISA  in  prognosticating COVID19 immunological methods will undoubtedly occupy a crucial role in achieving all levels of the WHO�s short medium and longterm diagnostic goalsCOVID19 Research ToolsImmunological ApproachesCOVID19  infection  has  a  poor  prognosis  in  individuals with  comorbidities  and  abnormal  immune  functions Although  research  surrounding  COVID19  is  still  in  its infancy several studies have revealed lymphopenia and the cytokine  storm  as  underlying  mechanisms  correlating  to disease progression Here we discuss the various immunological techniques involved in assessing host immunity in COVID19 patientsELISA  As  discussed  ELISA  has  also  been  used  to  detect the  inflammatory  cytokines  implicated  in  the  cytokine storm seen in patients with severe respiratory failure due to COVID19  One  study  found  that  the  immune  dysregulation in patients with severe respiratory failure was due to a significantly  increased  production  of  IL6  and  defective lymphoid function because of an IL6mediated decrease in HLADR  expression  on  CD14  monocytes  Interestingly interferongamma  IFNγ  levels  were  below  the  detection level in these patients suggesting that T helper Th  cells are  unlikely  to  be  major  players  in  the  overinflammatory response  of  severe  patients61  A  similar  observation  was made in a separate study whereby inflammatory cytokines that mediate major immune responses such as TNFα and IL1β  were  not  significantly  elevated  in  ICU  patients62 These findings demonstrate that the immunophenotype of patients with COVID19 can vary depending on presently unclear host immune factors and the severity of their condition This  relationship  between  disease  severity  and  cytokine storm has also been highlighted in other studies that found  a  significantly  elevated  plasma  concentration  of granulocyte  colonystimulating  factor  GCSF  IP10 CCL2 and CCL3 in ICU patients compared with nonICU patients63ELISA is also being used as a companion diagnostic tool for therapeutic purposes In a study that explored the use of convalescent plasma therapy from donors as a form of treatment in severe COVID19 ELISA was used to assess the neutralizing activity of the RBDspecific IgM and IgG antibodies found in the donor convalescent plasma64 After the transfusion was complete ELISA was also used to detect IgG  IgM  and  neutralizing  antibody  titers  in  the  sera  of patients to assess the response to treatment65EnzymeLinked Immunosorbent Spot  Enzymelinked immunosorbent spot ELISPOT is a sensitive immunoassay that quantitatively measures cytokinesecreting cells at the singlecell level providing insight into immunerelated cellular activities66 Hence it is a promising tool for characterizing specific Tcell  immunity  in  COVID19  patients  By  IFNγ ELISPOT  analysis  it  was  revealed  that  convalescent COVID19  patients  had  significantly  increased  levels  of IFNγsecreting T cells when compared with healthy donors A  significant  correlation  between  neutralizing  antibody titers and NPspecific T cells was identified in these patients suggesting  that  a  combination  of  humoral  and  cellular immunity  is  integral  to  clearing  SARSCoV2  Interestingly  it  was  noted  that  in  convalescent  patients    weeks IFNγsecreting  Tcell  numbers  had postdischarge decreased suggesting that they may not be maintained for a prolonged period of time even in recovered patients67ELISPOT is also serving a vital role in vaccine development through the detection of potential Tcell epitopes in  the  S  protein  RBD  of  SARSCoV268  One  study  was able  to  harness  ELISPOT  assays  to  identify  three  Tcell epitopes that induced a strong adaptive immune response  0c SLAS Technology  postimmunization demonstrating the promise of ELISPOT assays  in  the  area  of  vaccine  development32  Recently ELISPOT has also been applied to assess the immunogenicity of newly developed vaccines One such study successfully  utilized  an  IFNγ  ELISPOT  assay  to  evaluate Tcell responses to a new SARSCoV2 vaccine in murine splenocytes and rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs The promising findings from this animal study informed the start of a phase I clinical trial with  the  same  vaccine  highlighting  the  usefulness  of ELISPOT in assessing immune responses to new vaccines and promoting vaccine development69Flow Cytometry  Unlike ELISA and ELISPOT flow cytometry determines the number of cytokinesecreting cells and has the capacity to immunophenotype based on surface and intracellular markers70 In relation to the current pandemic this technique enables the detection sorting and analysis of multiple subpopulations of immune cells specific to COVID Using flow cytometry researchers detected a cytotoxic immune  environment  in  patient  blood  samples  despite  a reduction in the overall lymphocyte population71� As part of the SARSCoV2 antiviral response peripheral lymphocytes  retain  the  capacity  to  activate  and  differentiate  into subpopulations  such  as  antibodysecreting  cells  CD3�CD19CD27hiCD38hi follicular T cells CD4CXCR5ICOSPD1  CD4 Th  cells  CD38HLADRCD4  cytotoxic T Tc cells CD38HLADRCD8 and regulatory T  Treg  cells  CD3CD4CD25CD127�  These  Tc cells harbor large amounts of cytotoxic granules while CD4 Th  cells  skewed  toward  a  proinflammatory Th1  and  Th17 phenotype727375 The overall hyperinflammation and cytotoxic environment supports the notion that a cytokine storm could be liable for the multisystemic insults in patients with severe COVID19Elicitation of antiviral Tcell responses specific to SARSCoV2 is of utmost importance to establishing viral control Many studies have demonstrated robust antiviral responses however there is no known set of markers reported to identify  SARSCoV2specific  T  cells  Collectively  most groups  have  characterized  SARSCoV2specific  T  cells based on HLADR CD38 CD69 CD25 CD44 and Ki67 expression T</td></tr><tr><td>Thyroid_Cancer</td><td> Cabozantinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor whose targets include vascular endothelial growth factor

primarily in older adults [] In addition to the underlying HCC etiology older adults with HCC are likely to have additional comorbidities such as cardiovascular or pulmonary disease [] and it is not uncommon for patients with HCC to have multiple comorbidities [] Liver cirrhosis with compromised liver function and decreased hepatic reserve is a major risk factor for HCC development Other HCCrelated comorbidities include hepatitis B virushepatitis C virus infection alcoholic liver disease NASH and diabetes [] In addition metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperlipidemia and hypertension is linked to development of NAFLD which may progress to NASH cirrhosis and finally HCC [] For patients with HCC assessment of liver function is a key step in treatment decisionmaking [] Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are predominantly excluded from clinical trials in HCC therefore treatment of these patients is complicated by a lack of prospective clinical data as well as competing comorbidities []Although the number of patients with HCC and prior an transplant is limited these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and treatment is complicated by the need for immunosuppression TKIs may be used to treat posttransplant HCC recurrence although supporting data are limited The use of TKIs in these patients is complex so treatment decisions should involve collaboration between the oncology and transplant medicine care teams The use of sorafenib in patients receiving mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitorbased immunosuppression has been associated with an increased risk of fatal bleeding [ ] Immunotherapies are associated with an increased risk of an rejection in posttransplant patients []   Cabozantinib Clearance and a0ExposureTKIs are associated with high interpatient variability in clearance and exposure which may affect both efficacy and tolerability This variability may be due to a variety of factors including genetic background drug�drug interactions drugfood interactions and renal or hepatic impairment [] As evidenced by exposureresponse modeling patients with low clearance of cabozantinib may have higher exposure and an increased risk of developing certain AEs [ ] Awareness of these nuances may help clinicians to mitigate their effects thereby balancing efficacy with tolerability   Hepatic and a0Renal ImpairmentAccording to pharmacokinetic analyses of patients with HCC and other tumor types mild hepatic impairment is predicted to have a minimal effect on cabozantinib exposure [] therefore adjustment of the recommended 60mg starting dose is not necessary for patients with Child�Pugh A 0cliver function [ ] Data on the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib in patients with moderate ChildPugh B or severe Child�Pugh C hepatic impairment are limited [] As per the US Food and Drug Administration FDA prescribing information the starting dose of cabozantinib should be reduced to  mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment while cabozantinib is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [] Note that the European Summary of Product Characteristics SmPC does not recommend dose adjustments for moderate hepatic impairment owing to limited data [] For patients with HCC increased exposure due to hepatic impairment should be considered if intolerable AEs develop and dose modification undertaken as recommended Fig a0 [ ] Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment owing to the potential for increased exposure although no dose adjustments are necessary Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment owing to lack of data on safety and efficacy in this population [  ]   Drug�Drug and a0Drug�Food InteractionsGiven the range of comorbidities that may exist in patients with advanced HCC it is important to review all concomitant medications for potential interactions prior to initiation of treatment with cabozantinib Certain medications and foods have been shown to modulate the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib which may in turn impact exposure levels efficacy and risk of AEs Cabozantinib is metabolized in the liver primarily by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 CYP3A4 [] therefore CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may impact exposure examples of CYP3A4 inducersinhibitors are shown in Electronic Supplementary Table a0 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitorsinducers should be avoided in patients receiving cabozantinib If concomitant administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary

any food as this may affect absorption [] The label recommends that cabozantinib be taken at least  h before or at least  h after eating [] Grapefruit and grapefruit juice are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and should be avoided [ ]Cabozantinib may be used with caution in patients who are receiving concurrent antiarrhythmics or other QTprolonging agents [] This is based on a study of patients with MTC who received a daily 140mg capsule dose of cabozantinib recommended for this indication in which the mean deltadelta QT interval was increased by approximately � a0ms with upper  CIs not exceeding  ms [] Such an increase is within the range considered to be acceptable for oncology drugs in this setting [] No patient in the aforementioned study or in CELESTIAL had a confirmed QTcF QT corrected using Fridericia�s method a0 ms [] which is considered clinically significant [] For patients receiving cabozantinib monitoring with periodic electrocardiogram and electrolyte measurements may be advisable particularly in patients with risk factors such as cardiac disease or a prior history of QT prolongation [] Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors PPIs such as esomeprazole does not affect cabozantinib exposure levels [] However PPIs may cause hypomagnesemia which is linked to an increased risk of QT prolongation [] Therefore coadministration of PPIs and cabozantinib should be undertaken with caution following an individualized assessment of the patient�s baseline magnesium levels and concomitant medications that may also influence QT   Pretreatment AssessmentsGiven the heterogeneity of the HCC patient population and the complexity associated with comorbidities and concomitant medications all patients should undergo a comprehensive assessment of medical history prior to initiation of treatment with cabozantinib Ideally the multidisciplinary care team should include an oncology pharmacist [] A �brown bag� medication review should be carried out prior to treatment initiation [] whereby the patient brings in all current medications including overthecounter medicines vitamins herbal remedies etc Therapeutic duplications should be eliminated for example concomitant PPIs and histamine H2 antagonists H2 blockers Switching and deprescribing should be considered where possible to minimize the risk of drugdrug interactions   Adverse Event ManagementThe AE profile of cabozantinib is generally similar to that of other VEGFRtargeting TKIs with GIrelated AEs fatigue PPE and hypertension being the most common AEs [] Other AEs that occur less frequently can also have a significant impact on quality of life QoL and treatment adherence such as mucosal inflammation [] Hepatobiliary AEs such as elevated AST alanine aminotransferase ALT and bilirubin are particularly relevant in the context of advanced HCC and need to be carefully monitoredProphylactic and supportive care measures for the more common cabozantinibassociated AEs grade  or tolerable

Palmar�Plantar ErythrodysesthesiaPPE is one of the more common events associated with anticancer therapies including VEGFRtargeting multikinase inhibitors [�] PPE is characterized by pain redness tingling and swelling of hands and feet [] Presentation may vary according to the etiologic agent PPE induced by TKIs is typically localized to pressurebearing areas in contrast to that caused by chemotherapy which has a more diffuse pattern It has been hypothesized that inhibition of multiple angiogenic pathways by TKIs may compromise repair of capillary microtrauma in areas exposed to mechanical stress such as the hands and feet [ ] Although not lifethreatening PPE can rapidly progress to a debilitating condition negatively impacting QoL [ ]Prophylaxis and prompt management of emerging symptoms may help to minimize the impact of PPE on QoL and adherence Table a0 Prophylactic measures predominantly involve skin care practices to remove hyperkeratotic areas and to minimize friction and damage prior to the start of treatment [ ] Recommendations include use of thick cotton gloves and socks padded insoles in shoes and avoidance of heat or friction on the hands and feet [ ]

SARSCoV2 ShACE2complex is shown in Fig 4a while the complexes between SARSCoV2 spike and different numbers of clayNamontmorillonite crystallites are respectively shownin Fig 4b c For comparison purposes total CEDs ofvarious proportionsnumbers of the clay crystallites onthe SARSCoV2 spike and the interaction of the laterwith hACE2 are plotted in Fig Based on our experience we have hypothesized thatnanoclays due to their high adhesive properties couldalso act as SARSCoV2 inhibitors They can do it bystrongly associating with the spike S present on SARSCoV2 The results obtained from the molecularlevelsimulations of the interactions indicate that due to veryhigh CED between SARSCoV2 and the nanoclays ascompared to the former and hACE2 Fig  they couldinhibit SARSCoV2 from getting engaged with hACE2Moreover it could also be concluded from Fig  thatthe extent of inhibition due to nanoclays is increased inquantity dosagedependent wayNanoclay Interactions with SARSCoV2

while a zeta potential of less than  mV generally results in agglomeration Higher dispersion tendencies ZP of the clay nanops used in the study �� to ��  mV lead to higher dispersion tendency andhence in the generation of higher surface area amplifyingthe interactions with the SARSCoV2 spike Althoughbased on their ZP Namontmorillonite nanopshave hydrophilic nature they in the presence of saltsalso promote secondary adhesion mechanisms betweenhydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces [] It should alsobe noted that these clay nanops have high dispersion tendency due to their hydrophilic nature and relatively higher repulsive acidbase AB interactions Table High dispersion in turn results in the generation ofhigh surface area for increasing the attractive interactions Higher surface areas promote larger attractionsdue to the van der Waal attractions and the electrostaticforces among oppositely charged surfaces Besides although of relatively lesser degree positively chargededges of Namontmorillonite ps also get electrically attracted to the spike SThe results of the molecularlevel simulations for theinteraction of SARSCoV2 spike S with the clay crystallites Fig  also confirm the above interaction behaviors It has been observed that the sorption of the claynanops results in the formation of closely interacting strong van der Waals attraction fields These van derWaals

theviruses into the cell by preventing the attachment of viruses to their target receptor on the cell Antibody binding can occur at different sites on the surface proteinleading to various mechanisms that cause the same effect In the case of SARSCoV2 two viral neutralizationmechanisms by antibodies have been observed [ ]and shown in Fig 1c d One of the mechanisms involvesdirect binding of antibodies to the attachment site of theSARSCoV2RBD resulting in the antibody competingwith the target receptor hACE2 Another mechanism involves the binding of antibodies to the other sites onRBD

Purpose of Review Recognize which are the elements that predict why a person is aging faster or slower and which interventionwe can arrange to slow down the process which permits to prevent or delay the progression of multimorbidity and disabilityRecent Findings Aging is a complex process that leads to changes in all the systems of the body and all the functions of theperson however aging develops at different rates in different people and chronological age is not always consistent withbiological ageSummary Gerontologists are focused not only on finding the best theory able to explain aging but also on identifying one or moremarkers which are able to describe aging processes These biomarkers are necessary to better define the agingrelated pathologies manage multimorbidity and improve the quality of life The aim of this paper is to review the most recent evidence onaging biomarkers and the clusters related to them for personalization of treatmentsKeywords Biomarker of aging

by changes that take place at different levels ofbiological systems Biological age is of course influenced bychronological age but chronological age is by itself not representative of biological age

stressors [] If any definition of aging may appear incompleteand insufficient much more difficult and complex is to findthe marker or biomarker that can identify itMany theories currently trying to explain aging processesand many biomarkers are identified to measure aging and itsevolutionary stages Theories and biomarkers are not studiedto extend life span but to guide therapeutic choices and optimize patient management and personalization of careThe purpose of this paper is not purely to list which biomarkers are able to identify the various stages of aging ratherexplain how an epiphenomenon natural and physiological isso complex [] how many factors are protagonists in its development and how many actors and characters play in maximizing its individual features taking into account social andmorbidity biomarker These factors such as frailty loss ofautonomy essential needs and comorbidities influence theaging process and are able to justify why the biological ageof a person living in a country does not correspond to the ageof another person living in a country with better sociosanitaryconditionsClinical and Biological Aging PhenotypesThe aging phenotype can be described as a complex mosaicresulting from the interaction of a variety of environmentalstochastic and genetic�epigenetic eventsstimuli impinginglifelong on our body [ ]There is no clear evidence which molecular cellular orphysiological changes are the most important drivers of theaging process andor how they influence one another [] In itsbroadest sense aging merely refers to the changes that occurduring an anisms� life span though the rate at which thesetake place varies widely [] Despite its enormous complexityinvolving combinations of these variables a small number ofbasic molecular mechanisms underpin the aging process including a set of evolutionary highly conserved basic biological mechanisms responsible for body maintenance and repairOne of the key mechanisms is inflammation a typical featureof the aging process is the development of a chronic lowgrade inflammatory status named �inflammaging� [8cid129] whichemerged as critical in the pathogenesis of major agerelatedchronic diseases such as atherosclerosis type  diabetes and neuro degeneration Inflammaging plays a pivotal role in themost important geriatric conditions such as sarc ia [9cid129cid129]osteoporosis [] frailty and disability thus contributing tomortality [] Interestingly a variety of tissues adipose tissue muscle ans brain liver systems immune systemand ecosystems gut microbiota of the body indicated as�subsystems� can contribute to the onset and progressionof such a systemic inflammatory state [] by increasing theproduction of several proinflammatory mediators or loweringthat of the antiinflammatory ones [8cid129]To differentiate the innocuous changes from those leadingto increased risk of disease disability or death biogerontologists tend to use a more precise term�senescence�when describing aging [] Senescence is thereforethe progressive deterioration of bodily functions over time andnormal human aging has been associated with a loss of complexity in a wide range of physiological processes and anatomic structures [] including blood pressure [] strideintervals [] respiratory cycles [] and vision [] amongothers such as postural dynamics [] ultimately leading todecreased fertility and increased risk or mortality []Systemic consequences of aging are widespread but theycan be clustered into four domains Fig � Changing in body composition�The balance between energy availability and energydemandSignaling networks that maintain homeostasis�� NeurodegenerationThese changes develop in parallel and affect each otherthrough many feedforward and feedback loopThe phenotype that results from the aging process is characterized by increased susceptibility to disease high risk ofmultiple coexisting diseases impaired response to stress theemergence of �geriatric syndromes� altered response to treatment high risk of disability and loss of personal autonomywith all its psychological and social consequences On theother hand all these factors influence aging itself in a dynamic and parallel way so that they can be considered as not onlya consequence of aging but also an integral part of the agingprocessTheories of AgingHuman aging is currently defined as a dynamic process involving the continual adaptation of the body to lifelong exposure tointernal and external damaging as conceptualized in the �remodelling theory of aging� [21cid129cid129] Theories of aging are generallyclassified as either program or damage theories Programmedaging theories suggest that there is a deliberate deterioration withage because a limited life span results in evolutionary benefits[] This plan could be a result of �aging genes� The firstdescribed mutation to yield a significant extension in the life spanof Caenorhabditis elegans was in the ageI gene which wasshown to result in a  increase in mean life span and a increase in maximum life span of this anism []Evolutionary biologists may argue that aging occurs due to theabsence of natural selection at the postreproductive stage of life[] Although such aging theories are subjectively appealing asthey convey a cure for aging the accumulation of damage is aspontaneous entropydriven process [] Among the damage 0cCurr Oncol Rep            Fig  Systemic consequences ofagingPage  of     theories a prevailing idea is that of oxidative damage Reactiveoxygen species ROS are generated during metabolism throughseveral interrelated reactions The supposition that aging may becaused by ROS has been further substantiated by studies involving transgenic animals for genes encoding antioxidants The lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster has been extended by overexpression of both superoxide dismutase SOD and catalase bothantioxidant enzymes [] Since mitochondria are the major producer of ROS in mammalian cells mitochondrial DNAmtDNA is therefore particularly susceptible to oxidative damage [] Mitochondrial maintenance is therefore essential topreserve cellular homeostasis and impaired mitochondrial maintenance has been described as a shared hallmark of numeroushuman pathologies and aging [] Mitochondrial DNA varieswith age and it is commonly considered that DNA hypomethylation is a typical aspect of the aging process [] ROS are activeintermediates of DNA methylation as well as histone modification These reactive oxygen species may play a role in epigeneticprocesses physiological phenotypic variations caused by external or environmental factors that switch genes onoff throughreactions of nucleophilic substitution at the DNA levelConsequently it has been suggested that better preservation ofDNA methylation levels slower cell metabolism and improvedcontrol in signal transmission through epigenetic mechanismscould be key processes involved in human longevity Oxidativedamage to proteins is irreversible and irreparable [] and mustbe degraded by the proteasome The proteasome is the mostimportant proteolytic machinery in eukaryotic cells largely responsible for the removal of oxidized proteins and the preventionof its aggregation [] However it has been shown that theactivity of proteasome is impaired during aging leading to theaccumulation of oxidizing proteins aggresome and lipofuscinsocalled the age pigment Similarly to oxidative damage nitrosamine damage�that caused by reactive nitrogen speciesRNS such as nitric oxide�has been suggested to also contribute to agerelated diseases namely hepatic steatosis and apoptosis [] as well as functional and structural changes in the cardiovascular system [ ] sleep homeostasis [] psychological disorders [] and dementia []Most supporters of the genomic instability theory of agingrefer to telomere shortening [] and mutation in DNA mitochondrial Telomeres are the repeated DNA sequences at theends of linear chromosomes which are unable to be fullyreplicated by DNA polymerasesMutations in mtDNA cause a wide range of human mitochondrial diseases and have been implicated in agerelateddiseases and agingBiomarker FeaturesFinding the biomarker of aging is one of the most importantgoals of medicine The National Institutes of HealthBiomarkers Definitions Working Group defined a biomarkeras �a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluatedas an indicator of normal biological processes pathogenicprocesses or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention� []The American Federation for Aging Research AFAR recommends the following criteria for biomarkers of aging [39cid129]It must predict a person�s physiological cognitive andphysical function in an agerelated way independentlyof chronological age 0c    Page  of Curr Oncol Rep            It must be testable and not harmful to test subjects forexample a blood test or an imaging technique it mustalso be technically simple to perform and it must be accurate and reproducibly without the need for specializedequipment or techniquesIt should work in laboratory animals as well as humanssince preliminary testing is always done in nonhumansubjectsFerrucci et al reviewed the biomarkers proposed as elements of a theory based on the balance between �resiliencemechanisms� and �accumulated damages� where biomarkersact in reducing resilience mechanisms or increasing damages[40cid129] Tables  and The pathways eligible to become biomarkers are thefollowingGenomic Instability Endogenous and exogenous agents continuously challenge the integrity of DNA when DNA repairmechanisms cannot manage the repeated damage the result isan accumulation of DNA somatic mutations This phenomenon causes dysregulation of gene expression and the production of altered proteins that lead to cellular damage Somaticmutation accumulation has been observed in skeletal musclecells neurons and lymphocytes B related to aging [�]nevertheless quantification of DNA repair capacity in humanshas yet to be finalized [�]Telomere Attrition Telomeres are the DNA sequences that areplaced at the

circulating cells however no techniqueshave been validated for evaluating aging because of the heterogeneity between different cells between individuals andhigh measurement errors that make these techniques not yetvalid in clinical practice [�]Epigenetic Alterations Epigenetics refers to those mechanismsexternal to DNA that modulate gene expression in cells theregulation of gene expression determines the phenotypic characteristics of the different cells and tissues The main mechanismsare DNA methylation histone modification and noncodingRNA While DNA methylation is easily measured in circulatingcells and seems to be correlated to aging [ ] measuringhistone modification or noncoding RNA is difficult and expensive Recent evidence correlates DNA methylation with agingand agerelated

be agood biomarker but to date there are no valid techniques forthis purposeMitochondrial Dysfunction The main role of mitochondria isto guarantee energy for the cell through the production ofATP They are also involved in signaling by the productionof ROS and in apoptosisprogrammed cell deathMitochondrial dysfunction is a good biomarker of aging andis associated with disability in older persons through the reduction of muscle strength [65cid129]Many techniques are measuring oxidative phosphorylationand ROS generation that have been associated with chronicdisease [ ] nevertheless the relation with aging is notcompletely validatedCellular Senescence Genomic instability telomere shorteningand other endogenous and exogenous mechanisms can inducethe cell to activate specific pathways that lead to apoptosis[] This process is called cellular senescence and is characterized by structural and functional changes in the cell []Senescent cells produce proinflammatory cytokines andchemokines growth factors and matrix proteases called �senescenceassociated secretory phenotype� SASP [ ]which may induce some agerelated diseases [�] Thedetection of SASP has been proposed as a biomarker of aging[]Deregulated NutrientSensing Genetic mutations in growthhormone and the insulinlike growth factor have been linkedto longevity [] Moreover dietary restriction showed to increase life span in primates [ ] For these reasons thispathway has been proposed as biomarkers of agingSteam Cell Exhaustion The decline in the regenerative potential is one of the elements at the base of aging [] Despitepharmacological interventions being explored to counteractthis phenomenon [] evidences are still poor 0c    Page  of Curr Oncol Rep            Altered Intercellular Communication With aging we also observe changes in intercellular communication as inflammatory reaction increases the other communication ways becomedysfunctional endocrine neuronal immune system []As we discussed earlier inflammation can be inappropriately increased in aging and this has been related to agerelated disease [ ]Indeed the pathways described as potential biomarkers ofaging are strongly related to inflammation for this reasonmeasuring circulating levels of cytokines is considered anew field of research [ 84cid129 ]Aging and Life ExpectancyAging and life expectancy are closely related In a broadsense determining an individual�s life expectancy is also away of schematizing his or her aging process Life expectancyis a statistical measure of the average time an anism isexpected to live based on the year of its birth LEB itscurrent age and demographic factors including gender []In the last decades life expectancy has increased in high income country the rise in human life expectancy has involveddeclines in intrinsic and extrinsic mortality processes associated respectively with senescence and environmental challenges []In association to this increased longevity there are diseasescalled agerelated that increase quadratically with age andcause a progressive loss of physical mental and cognitiveintegrities leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to morbidity mortality [] and disability in additionto increasing care needs and agerelated burden measuredthrough the sum of disabilityadjusted life years DALYs ofthese diseases among these adults Fig  Ninetytwo of the of the Global Burden of Disease causes were identified asagerelated diseases In particular cardiovascular diseaseneoplasm and chronic respiratory disorders are those withhigher agerelated disease burden []Determinants of Frailty Syndrome as AgingBiomarkerFrailty can be defined as a state of increased vulnerabilityto stressors or a loss of capacity to resolve homeostasisperturbation Frailty condition is closely related to aging[88cid129cid129] and the frailty indexes can consequently be considered biomarkers of aging themselves In frail individuals it is possible to find both changing in body composition and balance between energy availability and energydemand Moreover in the definition of frailty it is welldescribed how signaling networks maintain homeostasisand association with neurodegeneration These fouraspects all refer to the hallmarks of aging Frailty is associated with adverse clinical outcomes including falls institutionalization and death [88cid129cid129]Two principal models emerged in the last decades that areable to conceptualize and consequently measure frailty in everyday clinical practice and research the �frailty phenotype�model and the cumulative deficits modelThe frailty phenotype was first described by Fried and colleagues in  analyzing data from the CardiovascularHealth Study CHS involving  men and women aged years and older In this study it was investigated whichcharacteristics of the population were predictive of falls disability hospitalization and death Their operational definitionof frailty

there is no single biomarker to date that has beenfound able to identify the stage of this process At thesame time clinical clusters have been added to purelybiological markers and social ones should

used for detecting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cells of human and animal tissue RNAseq N   IHC N   RTPCR N   in a0situ hybridization ISH N   and WB N   Different detection approaches were used in  studies [ ] One study reported specific genetic analysis [] There were significant differences between studies regarding methods used While Ziegler et a0al and Sungnak et a0al detected ACE2 by RNAseq in goblet cells Lee et a0al did not find any immunohistochemical labeling [  ] However the results reported in sustentacular cells agree in the same direction whatever the technique used whether by RNAseq or by ISH and immunocytochemistry [�] The discrepancies are rather observed between studies having performed immunohistochemistry Indeed using two different antibodies Hikmet did not find ACE2 expression in nasopharynx epithelium whereas others demonstrated the staining of the apical surface of epithelia and ciliated epithelial cells [  ] Interestingly all the studies which carried out RNAseq found an expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 at the epithelial level which implies that the technique used could generate biases between the studies [ � �] 0cHead and Neck Pathology DiscussionThe presentation of COVID19 infection may be in several clinical forms ranging from anosmia in isolation to severe multiple an failure and death The mechanisms underlying the COVID19 polymorphism are still unknown To infect tissues SARSCoV2 needs to entry into the cells which is allowed through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors [] The identification of virus receptor expression in the tissues makes particularly sense to better understand the clinical expression of the disease This systematic review sheds light on many pointsFirst ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors are expressed in epithelial and nonepithelial cells throughout the head and neck The head and neck expression may support the otolaryngological clinical picture of the disease which was recently found in European and North American COVID patients [   ] By entering the body via the epithelial cells of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa the SARSCoV2 virus leads to an inflammatory reaction and the development of otolaryngological symptoms Nasal entrance of the virus through high ACE2 expression was supported in the study of Wu et a0al who found a higher virus concentration in nasal swabs compared with throat swabs []The olfactory cleft is a nasal region that has drawn the attention of many researchers over the past few weeks Indeed recent data supported that more than  of COVID19 patients developed subjective olfactory dysfunction especially when patients suffered from mildtomoderate forms of the disease [   ] Because ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in the nasal mucosa of the olfactory cleft entrance into the olfactory bulb seems plausible Once in the bulb according to some human studies [ ] the virus could infect cells that express ACE2 or TMPRSS2 namely glial and neuronal stem cells Fig a0Integrating the molecular clinical and radiological characteristics of SARSCOV2 olfactory loss may shed light about its pathophysiological process Taking into account that the loss is often temporary SARSCOV2 may primarily infect the sustentacular cells supporting the olfactory sensory neurons This infection may cause rapid disruption of the olfactory epithelium structure and function with a possible inflammatory response inducing sudden onset smell loss This inflammation is observed in a minority of patient with congested olfactory cleft who underwent CT scan [   �]ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also found in horizontal basal olfactory stem cells located in the basal layer They are less exposed to the external environment thus less likely to be infected in first line the loss would have been more Fig    Epithelium of Olfactory Cleft The figure summarizes the olfactory cleft epithelium 0c Head and Neck Pathologyprogressive However once infected they might slow down recovery time because horizontal basal cells give rise to many cell type in the olfactory epithelium They may also contribute to virus spread to the olfactory bulb vascular pericytes Magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies of the olfactory bulb [ ] in which ACE2 are only expressed in vascular pericytes but not in neurons may show inflammatory signs suggesting that the infection process can extend more centrally and promote inflammatory response [] Inflammatory causes are often quickly reversible for example after a oneweek trial of high dose of corticosteroids or simply days after the resolution of the viral infection suggesting that the olfactory neurons and bulbs are still somewhat intact This seems to be the case for a majority of patients In contrast with more sustained destruction of neuronal olfactory structures the recovery time is much longer and may take � a0years given the slow neuroregeneration process [ ]In this systematic review we found that three studies reported high ACE2 expression in major or minor salivary gland human tissues [  ] These data corroborate the literature findings that reported a salivary pattern of SARSCoV2 and related parotitis [ ] Moreover the virus spread into the salivary gland tissues allows us a better understanding the mechanisms underlying salivary transmission Interestingly in  Liu et a0al observed that monkeys infected by SARSCoV had a salivary viral spread which was associated with a salivary virion excretion [] These data support the need to conduct future studies investigating the presence of SARSCoV2 in the saliva of infected human and to corroborate the saliva findings with the ACE2 salivary gland expressionThe head and neck expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and the related otolaryngological symptom pattern seems obvious but could vary across individuals and populations In support of this Lee et a0al observed that ACE2 expression is influenced by patient demographics clinical characteristics comorbidities and medication [] As reported in the genetic analysis of Cao et a0al there would be different susceptibilities or responses to SARSCoV2 in different populations [] The polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression could explain the clinical differences between individuals Indeed many physicians reported in clinical and epidemiological studies different clinical presentation of the disease [ ] which could be associated with virus mutations [  ] The virus mutations and the related impact on receptor binding and infectivity is another point that has to be considered in future studies Otherwise according to the Bgee database https bgee expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 evaluated in murine models may increase with age These findings have to be confirmed in humans but could explain more severe clinical pictures in the elderlyThe present study has several limitations First the heterogeneity between studies about the detection method may lead to detection bias as some approaches are more sensitive than others Some studies interrogate gene expression at mRNA level and others at protein levels both types of analysis having their advantages and limitations Compared to transcriptomic analyzes immunohistochemistry brings additional important spatial information in tissue samples but recently Sorokin et a0al demonstrated high and statistically significant correlations between the RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical measurements [] Interestingly they highlighted the complementarity of both techniques for measuring cancer biomarkers in FFPE samples However differences observed across IHC studies suggest the involvement of many parameters The antibody specificity is a big challenge to ensure reproducibility of antibodybased studies and given the high homology between ACE1 and ACE2 cautions must be taken regarding antibody selection Besides a report from the International Working Group for Antibody Validation IWGAV proposed five scientific approaches to validate antibody specificity [] then such strategies must be considered in future investigations to confirm the published observations In addition it seems essential to enlarge and diversify patient cohorts and to combine transcriptomic and proteomic strategies as well as colocalize different markers of SARSCoV2 such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to provide an accurate representation of ACE2 expression through all head and neck areas of the whole populationSecond the majority of studies that were conducted during the SARSCoV2 pandemic did not consider many demographic and clinical factors such as the age of patients from who the tissues were extracted or the use of ACE inhibitor medications among others Third some otolaryngological regions remain uninvestigated such as the vocal folds The investigation of these remaining regions may shed further light on some recently reported unusual clinical phenomena such as severe dysphonia []ConclusionACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in head and neck tissues which may explain the otolaryngological clinical pattern of the disease and the entry of SARSCoV2 into the host anism Future studies considering demographical and clinical characteristics of patients from who the tissues are extracted are needed to better understand the cell entry mechanisms of SARSCoV2Author contributions  JR TR SS JM design acquisition of data data analysis  interpretation

thoseof  healthy controls106 Similarly no significant difference in selenium concentration was noted between sixdogs with posttraumatic OA and six control dogs107Second the beneﬁcial effect of selenium supplementationin alleviating OA symptoms has been debated The resultsfrom a controlled doubleblind trial of  patientsOfﬁcial journal of the Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular

Suchsurveillance tasks require many epidemiological and statistical methods with geospatial features in investigatingepidemics preferably from localized areas The reason forpreferring the local areas

CNVR per goat breed was    CNVR50 breeds which is much smaller than the number we found here  CNVR We attribute this difference to the fact that the previous study included multiple caprine breeds that were represented by small to moderate numbers of individuals Given the low frequencies of CNV in our study the average frequency of CNV is  such a design would probably underestimate the levels of the diversity of CNV at the within�breed level We also observed that functions related with sensory perception metabolism and embryo development are overrepresented in the set of genes that overlapped with CNV and that these loci often belong to large multigene families with tens hundreds or thousands of paralogous members a feature that could favor the occurrence of duplications or

detect structural variations  in  cattle  have  revealed  that  CNV  regions CNVR are often enriched in genes that are involved in immunity [�] metabolism [ ] embryo development [ ] and sensory perception [ ] There is evidence that the  dNdS ratios of genes that map to taurine CNV are generally higher than those of genes that do not overlap with CNV which indicates that CNV genes probably evolve under reduced selective constraint [] The analysis of gene networks has also shown that genes that  colocalize  with  duplications  tend  to  have  fewer interactions with other genes than loci that do not overlap  with  CNV  reinforcing  the  idea  that  genes  mapping to duplicated regions have fewer essential housekeeping functions  than  nonCNV  genes  and  also  have  reduced pleiotropy []Although structural chromosomal variations can have strong  effects  on  gene  expression  and  phenotypic  variability  technical  limitations  and  the  moderate  quality of genome assemblies have hampered CNV mapping in livestock  []  Until  recently  this  has  been  particularly true for goats In  Fontanesi et a0al [] published the first  caprine  CNV  map  by  identifying  with  the  Bovine a0k aCGH array  CNVR including  and  copy loss and gain variants respectively Later on resequencing  the  genome  of  individuals  from  several  caprine breeds  made  it  possible  to  identify  CNV  that  overlap with  pigmentation genes and to detect an association between increased ASIP copy number and light pigmentation  []  The  first  worldwide  survey  of  copy  number  variation  in  goats  was  performed  within  the  Goat ADAPTmap Project httpwwwgoata daptm ap and involved the genomewide genotyping of  goats from  breeds [] This study resulted in the identification of  CNVR among which several overlapped with genes that  are  functionally  related  with  local  adaptation  such as coat color muscle development metabolic processes and embryonic development [] Moreover the patterns of the diversity of CNV differed according to geographic origin  which  indicates  that  they  have  been  influenced by population history [] In another study on  individuals from  East African goat breeds Nandolo et a0al [] detected  CNVR More recently Henkel et a0al [] demonstrated the existence of complex patterns of structural variation in the regions containing the caprine ASIP and KIT genes with potential causal effects on pigmentation In spite of these efforts the description of structural chromosomal  variation  in  goats  is  still  lagging  behind that of other domestic species Most of the CNV surveys in goats have analyzed large populations that represent a mixture of different breeds each with a limited number of individuals [ ] thus making it difficult to assess the magnitude of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level Our goal was to fill this gap by analyzing a population of  individuals from a single Spanish breed MurcianoGranadina  and  to  investigate  the  functional  roles  of genes that map to CNVR and compare these results with data obtained in composite goat populationsMethodsGenomic DNA extraction and a0high�throughput genotypingBlood  samples

analysis 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of DiscussionIn this work our aim was to characterize copy number variation  in  MurcianoGranadina  goats  a  native  Spanish breed used for milk production By genotyping  MurcianoGranadina  goats  with  a  SNP  array  we  were able  to  identify    CNVR  covering    of  the  goat genome  whereas  Liu  et a0 al  []  identified  CNVR  that covered   of the goat genome The latter higher percentage reported by Liu et a0al [] can be explained by the fact that they analyzed  breeds with different geographical  origins  ie  a  composite  population  that  is probably much more diverse than that used in our work Besides  the  pipeline  that  we  used  to  identify  CNVR is more stringent than that employed by Liu et a0al [] removing CNVR that were not consistently detected by PennCNV and QuantiSNP In the literature estimates of  to  for CNVR coverage in the human genome are reported [] Our results and those obtained by Liu et a0al [] are consistent with these valuesIndeed  when  Liu  et a0 al  []  calculated  the  CNVR length  for  each  breed  normalized  by  the  goat  genome size their results agreed well with our estimate of  For  instance  this  parameter  reached  values  of   in  goats  from  Southeastern  Africa  and    in  goats from  Northwestern  Africa  and  Eastern  Mediterranean whereas it was lowest  for individuals from West Asia  []  The  number  of  CNV  detected  at  the  withinbreed  level  by  Liu  et a0 al  []  was  on  average    CNV per breed and ranged from  to  whereas the average number of CNVR was only   per breed [] Since the number of detected CNVR is proportional to population size for most of the breeds investigated in [] the level of withinbreed CNV variation is probably underestimated In summary one important conclusion from our study is that the magnitude of CNV diversity at the withinbreed  level  is  likely  to  be  much  larger  than  that previously  reported  in  studies  that  analyzed  multiple populations  each  represented  by  a  small  or  moderate number of individualsMost of the CNVR that we report here ranged in size from  to a0kb with a mean size of a0kb Similarly the average CNVR size reported by Liu et a0al [] was a0kb Both estimates are quite large and reflect that mediumdensity SNP arrays are not well suited to detect small CNVR in spite of their high abundance In cattle the  average  sizes  of  CNVR  detected  with  the  Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip a0K SNPs [] Illumina wholegenome sequencing and PacBio sequencing []  were      and  a0 kb  respectively  Another consistent feature of CNVR is that in general their frequencies are low or very low In our study approximately   of  the  CNVR  had  frequencies  lower  than    and the average frequency was  Liu et a0al [] reported lower  CNVR  frequencies  ranging  from    Alpine and  Northern  European  goats  to    Northwestern African goats This decreased average CNVR frequency is  not  very  significant  and  probably  reflects  differences in  sampling  size  and  the  use  of  composite  populations with  multiple  breeds  each  one  with  its  specific  CNVR frequenciesThe CNVR detected in our study covered  proteincoding  genes  Pathway  analyses  reflected  a  substantial enrichment  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  olfactory  perception  which  is  consistent  with  previous  reports  in cattle [ ] In this regard there is an important difference between our results and those by Liu et a0al [] Whereas in the study of Liu et a0al [] the term �sensory perception� was underrepresented among the CNV genes fold enrichment   in our work the terms �olfactory transduction�  fold  enrichment    and  �Gprotein coupled  purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity�  fold enrichment    were  overrepresented  and  many CNV  genes  were  olfactory  receptors  The  two  terms mentioned  before  are  closely  related  because  a  broad array of purinergic receptors are differentially expressed in  the  olfactory  receptor  neurons  that  modulate  odor responsiveness  []  Moreover  purinergic  nucleotides are  important  neuromodulators  of  peripheral  auditory and visual sensory systems [] In cattle Keel et a0al [] reported that �sensory perception of smell� and �Gprotein  coupled  receptor  signaling  pathway�  were  significantly overrepresented in the proteincoding genes that overlapped  with  CNVR  Similarly  Upadhyay  et a0 al  [] showed that �sensory perceptions of smell� and �chemical  stimuli�  are  enriched  in  their  set  of  CNV  genes  A potential  explanation  for  the  underrepresentation  of the �sensory perception� functional category among the genes overlapping CNV reported by Liu et a0al [] could be that in goats these genes are not well annotated yet so the majority of them are identified with a LOC prefix and a number and as a consequence of this they are not  correctly  detected  by  PANTHER  []  thus  biasing the  results  obtained  in  the  gene  ontology  enrichment analysisLoci  belonging  to  large  multigene  families  might  be more  prone  to  colocalize  with  CNV  because  paralogous  genes  can  act  as  templates  in  nonallelic  homologous  recombination  events  which  promote  increases or  reductions  in  copy  number  []  It  should  be  noted that olfactory receptor genes constitute the largest gene superfamily  and  in  humans  more  than    genes  and pseudogenes  have  been  identified  []  In  cattle   olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes are distributed in    clusters  across    bovine  chromosomes  []  and similar numbers have been reported for pigs [] Moreover  purifying  selection  against  CNV  is  probably  less  0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of intense in regions that contain olfactoryreceptor genes than in genomic regions that contain genes with essential functions [] Interestingly copy number changes in the olfactory receptor genes of wild and domestic mammals might have consequences on food foraging as well as on mate and predator recognition [ ]In the set of genes that colocalize with CNVR we also detected  an  enrichment  of  loci  related  with  the  multigene  family  of  ATP  binding  cassette  ABC  transporters  a  result  that  agrees  well  with  previous  findings  in humans  [�]  and  cattle  [  ]  In  mammals  ABC transporters fulfill the mission of carrying a broad array of endogenous substrates such as amino acids peptides sugars anions and hydrophobic compounds and metabolites  across  lipid  membranes  At  least    ABC  genes that belong to eight subfamilies have been identified in the human genome [] Copy number variation in the human ABCC4 and ABCC6 genes is associated with susceptibility  to  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  [] and to the rare autosomal recessive disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum [] respectively Moreover largescale deletions of the human ABCA1 gene are a causative factor  for  hypoalphalipoproteinemia  []  a  disease  that  is characterized by the complete absence of the apolipoprotein AI and extremely low levels of plasma highdensity lipoprotein  HDL  cholesterol  We  also  found  a  highly significant enrichment of pathways related with embryo development  anteriorposterior  pattern  specification embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis as previously reported [] These pathways are featured by genes that belong to the Hox multigene family of transcription factors possibly reflecting the genomic instability of certain homeobox gene clusters as evidenced by the existence of many syntenyparalogy breakpoints and assembly gaps as outlined in comparative studies []Although  not  significant  after  correction  for  multiple testing  we  detected  an  enrichment  of  pathways  with metabolic  significance  such  as  prolactin  and  insulin signaling which could have an impact on milk production  and  growth  [�]  Interestingly  the  comparison of our work with that of Liu et a0al [] revealed  proteincoding genes that colocalize with the set of shared CNVR One of the most relevant shared genes encodes ASIP a protein that increases the ratio of pheomelanin to  eumelanin  by  binding  to  the  melanocortin    receptor  and  delivering  an  antagonist  signal  that  blocks  the downstream expression of eumelanogenic enzymes [] Mutations in the ASIP gene play critical roles in animal pigmentation [] For instance the causal factor of the white color typical of many sheep breeds is the ubiquitous expression of a duplicated copy of the ASIP coding sequence  which  is  regulated  by  a  duplicated  promoter corresponding  to  the  itchy  E3  ubiquitin  protein  ligase gene  [  ]  Although  some  studies  proposed  that  the ASIP CNV might be associated with different pigmentation patterns in goats [  ] no functional assay has verified an association of ASIP copy number with ASIP mRNA  levels  Another  interesting  shared  copy  number variable gene is ADAMTS20 which was also identified in two previous CNV surveys [ ] This gene encodes a metalloproteinase with an important role in melanoblast survival by mediating Kit signaling [] and in palatogenesis [] Bertolini et a0al [] performed a selection scan in white vs colored black and red goats and detected a selective sweep in the ADAMTS20 gene In the light of these  results  the  potential  involvement  of  a  structural variation  in  ADAMTS20  in  goat  pigmentation  should be explored further Moreover it is worthwhile to mention that several CNVR genes have functions related with production  and  reproduction  traits  For  instance  the NCKAP5 gene which colocalizes with CNVR_160_chr2 frequency   is associated with milk fat percentage in  cattle  []  Taking  the  above  evidence  into  account the implication of structural chromosomal variations in the  genetic  determinism  of  traits  of  economic  interest with a complex inheritance deserves further exploration by designing tools that allow inferring CNVR genotypes with high confidenceConclusionsWith  the  PennCNV  and  QuantiSNP  software  we detected    CNVR  in  the  genome  of  the  MurcianoGranadina  breed  In  a a0 previous  study  []  that  used  a less  stringent  pipeline  only  PennCNV  was  used  and included  multiple  populations  with  small  to  moderate  sample  sizes  the  average  number  of  CNVR  events per breed was   One conclusion of our study is that CNV surveys which are based on a broad array of breeds represented  by  only  a  few  individuals  underestimate the true levels of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level The main reason for this outcome is that since the majority of CNV have very low frequencies they cannot be detected efficiently when sample size is small and in consequence  much  of  the  existing  variation  is  missed We have also found that genes that overlap with CNV are functionally related with olfactory transduction embryo development  ABC  transporters  and  Gprotein  coupled purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity  Most  of  these genes  belong  to  large  multigene  families  encompassing tens  hundreds  or  thousands  of  paralogous  genes  that could act as substrates in nonallelic homologous recombination  events  which  is  one  of  the  main  mechanisms generating  duplications  and  deletions  in  humans  and other  species  Finally  we  detected  CNV  that  colocalize with the ASIP and ADAMTS20 pigmentation genes 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol

repeatedly partitioned into two nonoverlapping partsa training set and a holdout set For each partitioning the holdout set is used fortesting while the remainder is used for training The two most popular variants aretenfold crossvalidation 10fold CV where the data is split into ten mutually disjointfolds []Since our samples were more than  and to be sure that each fold contains thesame proportion of healthy and diabetic individuals we used the stratified 10foldcrossvalidation approach [] Therefore the results are reliable and more credibleWe applied four popular data mining approaches on the lncRNA variables regression knearest neighbors SVM and neural network classification algorithmsKNN algorithmThe knearest neighbor�s algorithm kNN is an algorithm for classifying variables regarding the closest training data in the feature space KNN uses an instancebasedlearning method which is one of the simplest algorithms among data mining techniques This method considers the nearest neighbors to each object and decides todedicate the object to classes [ ]SVM algorithmSupport Vector Machine SVM is a supervised algorithm which divides the featurespace called hyperplanes considering the target classes SVM computes classification bymaximizing the margin of the hyperplane that intercepts classes This algorithm plots amultidimensional hyperplane that divides classes and increases the margin betweenclasses to enhance the accuracy of classification We used different kernel functionsembedded in the SVM class of SVC library in python framework as a quadratic polynomial radial basis etc to classify the instance and to detect the best accuracy amongthem [�]Artificial neural networkArtificial Neural Network is a data processing algorithm that simulates the biologicalneural network in its computations A common problem in using ANN is that they actfundamentally as a black box and the parameters are set by the model so we cannotdemonstrate them [] we can just apply the model in our problems and obtain thehigh performance We used Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN Thestructure of a multilayer perceptron neural network has been demonstrated in Fig It maps a set of input data into a set of appropriate output classes It includes threelayers input layer hidden layer  output layer The principal function of neurons of the 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of Fig  Artificial Neural Network structureinput layer is to divide input Xi into neurons in the hidden layer The neuron of thehidden layer adds the appropriate weights of Wij to the input variables The output formula isYj � fWji XiX 10 11Where f is a simple threshold function that we considered sigmoid and hyperbolictangent function []In the present study a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN was performed The structure of MLPNN is as shown in Fig  It makes a map of input dataonto a set of suitable output dataThe RBF networks are another type of neural network In MLP each neuron considers the weighted sum of its input values in which each input value is multiplied by acoefficient and the results are the sum of values RBF is a more intuitive approach toMLP An RBFN classifies the inputs by calculating the input�s similarity to examplesfrom the training set Each RBFN neuron stores one of the examples from the trainingset as a �prototype� for classification of new input in each neuron the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype is calculated The input is dedicated to aclass when it has more similar to that class than the other classesLogistic regressionLogistic regression is a common approach for predictive modeling practices The functionpX provides probability output between  and  for all values of X where X1�Xp are

research conducted bySaeidi  and Mansoori  [ ] and the research of Parvizi and colleagues which 0cKazerouni  BMC Bioinformatics            Page  of is not published yet We integrated these three studies and our data mining analysiswas implemented in their studies The data were collected from  unrelated Iraniansubjects  T2DM patients and  healthy individuals matched for age and sexT2DM patients were recruited from individuals who referred to the Diabetic Clinic atShohada Hospital Tehran Iran In the current study we applied six lncRNAs expression and also six demographic variables including sex age weight height BMI andFBS for analysis and inputs of algorithms For the preprocessing phase we normalizedthe data inputs for KNN SVM and ANN models We also had low missing variablesand we replaced them with zero Table lncRNA extraction and selectionIncreasing evidence has suggested several lncRNAs are implicated in T2DM pathogenesis Recently human βcell transcriptome analysis showed lncRNAs dynamic regulation and abnormal expression of lncRNAs in T2DM [] However the extent oflncRNA deregulation in T2DM has yet to be determined To date more than100 susceptibility loci have been identified as being associated with T2DM at a genomewidesignificant level [ ] Considering this into account and by querying the GWAS catalog we candidated  lncRNAs LY86AS1 HCG27_201 LINC00523 LINC00994TPT1AS1and DKFZP as target genes for this studyThe large scale GWAS have recognized approximately  SNPs that were susceptibleto T2DM [] From there we used the GWAS catalog access in June  to create alist of SNPs associated with T2DM In the current study we selected six lncRNA forexpression analysis according to the scan carried out in the study of Mansoori  []and Saeedi  [] We selected variants that had associations with increased risk ofT2DM We applied a quantitative PCR analysis of lncRNA expression levels in the samples We calculated the respective amount of each lncRNAs

performance data mining algorithms in predicting diabetic patientswe considered AUC sensitivity specificity and plotted ROC curve for the folds we ranand showed the average curve and its range [ ]ResultsTable  shows the significant downregulation of PBMC expressions of the variables inthe T2DM group compared with the control group The AUC of each classificationtechnique has been demonstrated

ROC curves generally plot true positive rate on the Yaxis and false positive rate onthe Xaxis In other words a false positive rate of zero and a true positive rate of onein the top left corner of the

the othersDiscussionFor a medical diagnosis optimized approaches to gain useful and accurate outcomesare essential Applying machine learning and data mining methods to automate theprocess of diagnosis may assist practitioners to enhance the quality of their clinical decisions [ ]Since T2DM is one of the prevalent diseases with severe consequences [] developing efficient methods for early detection of the disease was the primary purpose of ourresearchRegardless of high number of lncRNAs in the RNA profile of human a few numbersof them has been proved to be biologically active The role of the few lncRNAs hasbeen identified but several studies discussed the significant impact of lncRNAs in diabetic people which may represent the role of abnormal expression of lncRNAs in thelncRNAs in

effective biomarkers for data mining algorithms and have afeasible power to be applied for prediction of T2DM Also in this research we optimized the parameters of every algorithm and used stratified 10fold crossvalidation togain the best performance To be mentioned in the nearest neighbor�s algorithm theparameter k was varied between one and nine to find the bestoptimized method andwe selected k   to have the best performance and the lowest standard deviation in theaccuracy of the folds In addition in choosing the parameters of the artificial neuralnetwork the number of hidden layer neurons

and combiningthem to get the best detection power of T2DM and performing four outstanding datamining algorithms and comparing their performances As the limitations of this studywe should account for the limited number of samples which is due to the high costs ofmeasuring the Long noncoding RNAs No doubt the higher number of samples wouldlead to higher performance and more reliable resultsConclusionIn this paper the performance of conventional data mining classification techniqueshas been calculated and compared for a dataset of patients referred for the screeningof type  diabetes to the Shohada Hospital Iran The biomarker applied in this studydemonstrated high diagnostic value and the diagnostic process is suitable which couldhelp in the diagnosis of prediabetes and T2DMThe classification techniques compared were support vector machine artificial neuralnetwork decision tree nearest neighbors and logistic regression In data mining it isnot possible to say one classification technique will always work best and it often depends on the number of samples their distribution and the choosing of the right algorithm In this research work SVM and Logistic

cancer CRC is one of the leading cause ofdeath worldwide More than  million patients are diagnosed with CRC every year [�] What�s more this lifethreaten disease kills nearly  million people annually []In north America and Europe the morbidity and mortalityremain at high level [] despite developments of cancerscreening and endoscopy [ ] In China CRC becomesthe 5th most diagnosed cancer and 5th most deadly cancer[�] Nearly  million new cases are diagnosed andabout  million people die from the disease every year []Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is firstline treatment for CRC patients [ ] Capecitabine a carbamatederivative of fluoropyrimidine is the backbone of CRCchemotherapy [ ] Asthe oral prodrug of fluorouracil 5FU it is widely used for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy due to its long stable durationlower toxicity and convenient dosing compared to infusional 5FU [ ] However this chemotherapeutic drughas only modest efficacy the response rates of 5FU foradvanced CRC is only  for single treatment and for combined chemotherapy [ ] The chemoresistance is recognized as a principal obstacle for cancer therapy [�] leading to tumor recurrence or metastasisespecially liver and lung metastasis and cause over  ofCRC mortality [] Intense researches on the mechanisms underlying the resistance revealed that changes oftumor cells themselves cause resistance although thesefindings are mainly restricted to tumor specimen examinewhich is not that suitable for posttreatment surveillanceWhat�s more CT computed tomography scan and colonoscopy are insensitive to micro metastasis despite theirgoodrecurrenceCapecitabineresistant patients could only be diagnosedwith cancer recurrence by CT scan or colonoscopy about� years after capecitabine therapy [] when tumorsare big enough to be discovered Thus good prognosticmarkers are indispensable for predicting capecitabineresistance in the early stage after capecitabine therapydetection ofaccuracytheforCancer cells and their microenvironment could interactwith each other Immune cells could dynamically reflectcancer status and display multifaceted functions in cancerdevelopment [�] Myeloid cells including monocytesmacrophages granulocytes neutrophils eosinophils basophils and mast cells play critical roles in cancer progression [�] Myeloidderived suppressor cells MDSCs aheterogeneous population of myeloid cells remain at different stages of differentiation are immature counterparts ofmyeloid cells in cancer MDSCs acquire immunosuppressive features and mainly inhibit lymphocytes including Tcells and NK cells [�] Recent studies report that chemotherapeutic agents like 5FU could interact with myeloid cells and influence antitumor efficacy [�]Vincent J  reported that 5FU selectively inducedMDSC apoptotic cell death and increase IFN� productionby tumorspecific CD8T cells [] Other researchersshowed that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and increased amount of HSP70 exosomes on MDSC by 5FUlead to MDSC activation [ ] Yuan Y  found thattumorassociated macrophages secret IL6 to induce 5FUchemoresistance []ImportantlyIn this study we discovered that the expression ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells was dramatically decreased in capecitabineresistant CRC patients after capecitabine adjuvanttherapy The expression level ofCD16 was closely related to poor prognosis after capecitabine therapythe downregulation ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells appeared as early as month after capecitabine therapy in patients who werediagnosed with capecitabineresistance by CT scansabout � years after the treatment The cutoff value ofCD16 expression  would be helpful for the prediction of capecitabine chemoresistance Further analysisdemonstrated that these CD11bCD16low��myeloid cellswere mainly immature

therapy Importantlydownregulation of CD16 was observed as early as month after capecitabine treatment which was moresensitive than CT scan indicating its great value in clinical application We determined the cutoff value ofCD16 expression  on neutrophils for the prediction of capecitabine chemoresistance which would behelpful for clinical application and further

CRC surveillance as well especiallyCEA [] However CEA and CA199 cannot predictcancer progression so precisely and the false positivelead to anxiety and excessiveor negative results willtherapy What�s more some clinicaltrial also suggested that combining CEA and CT got no advantagecompared with single examine [] In this study ourresults showed that CD16 expression could serve as agood prognostic marker for poor CRC progressionafter capecitabine therapy Analyzation of CD16 expression hasthe downregulation of CD16 expression on neutrophils couldbe observed atcapecitabineresistance after the treatment Fig  Previous studieshave demonstrated that  CRC patients had primary resistance to 5FU single treatment[ ]thus the marker is essential for the drugselection inthese patients Second this marker is quite accuratefor predicting capecitabineresistance after the therapy In our study we collected totally  CRC patients with capecitabinetheexpression level of CD16 on neutrophils Among

healthCapecitabine the oral form of 5FU which is widelyused in CRC therapy has only modest efficacy due tothe chemoresistance Great efforts have been taken tofind out the mechanism Previous studies mainly concentrated on tumor cells themselves such as expressionof specific genes or generation of particular tumor cells[ ] In this research we worked on the correlationbetween changes on immune system and capecitabinechemoresistance and illustrated the conversion fromneutrophilsto immunosuppressive PMNMDSClikeneutrophils in these capecitabine insensitive patients byRNA sequencing and flow cytometry Our conclusioncould also be supported by other studies that 5FUcould promote MDSC protumor function The study byBruchard M  found that 5FU could activate NLRP3inflammasome in MDSC and promote tumor growth[] Gobbo J  also discovered that 5FU facilitatedproduction of tumorderived HSP70 exosomes whichfavored MDSC activation [] Thus prevention ofMDSC function after capecitabine or 5FU therapyholds great promise for improving drug efficacyreceptorResearchers have revealed that CD16myeloid cellswere tightly related to CRC development[ ]Giulio S  found that CD16myeloid cell infiltration in CRC tumor tissue represented favorable prognosis [] and by using in vitro studies these studiesalso demonstrated that colon cancer infiltrate neutrophils enhance the responsiveness of CD8 T cells byTcelltriggering [] Our work differedfrom theirs in some ways Firstly our study focusedon CRC patients who received capecitabine adjuvanttreatment after surgery while Giulio Spagnoli groupfocused on all CRC patients and some healthy donorsSecondly biopsies from different positions were analyzed Peripheral blood was used in our study whileGiulio Spagnoli group mainly focused on tumor biopsies Exceptthese differences some of our resultswere also consistent with studies from Giulio Spagnoligroup Firstly both our data and Giulio Spagnoligroup�s data found that phenotype of peripheral bloodCD11bCD16myeloid cells had no difference betweenhealthy donors and CRC patients without capecitabinetherapy Fig S1F and G Secondly our work indicated that CD16 highpositive expression after capecitabine therapy predicted sensitivity to the therapyand good prognosis These results were consistentwith the work from Giulio Spagnoli groupthatCD16myeloid cells related to good prognosis of CRCpatientsMDSCs are a heterogeneous population of myeloidcells stay at different stages of differentiation PMNMDSCs are a great part of MDSCs that could be considered as counterparts of immature granulocytes chieflyimmature neutrophils []In this study we founddownregulation of CD16 expression on myeloid cells incapecitabineinsensitive CRC patients after capecitabinetreatment These CD16low��myeloid cells after the therapy were mainly immature neutrophils CD16 is a lowaffinity Fc� receptor which could activate antibodydependent process like phagocytosis in neutrophils andother phagocytes [] It is expressed on neutrophilsduring the maturation Researchers also revealed thatCD16 is typically associated with PMN activation andphagocytosis and its expression will change in differentmaturation status [ ] MDSCs could exert protumor roles mainly through inhibition of effective Tcells and NK cells [ ] Our study demonstrated thatlow expression of CD16 on neutrophils after the therapywas related to decreased frequencies of antitumor immune cells like CD8T cells and NK cells suggestingthatthey may have immunosuppressive activity asMDSCs The mechanism underlying the changes induced by capecitabine would be investigated further andit could be a good target to compete against capecitabinechemoresistanceConclusionsIn conclusion CD16 seems to be a promising target

isstatistically significant compared with T0pain which is the main cause of readmission after daysurgery []According to the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology[] systemic opioids given to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery with general anesthesia activate opioidreceptors and stimulate various ans This often results in nausea and vomiting pruritus urinary retentionexcessive sedation and respiratory inhibition Thusinprinciple systemic opioids are not used for postoperativepain relief after day surgery The analgesic and adversereactions of mixed agonistantagonist opioids such asnalbuphine and dezocine also exhibit a ceiling effectImplementation of multimodal analgesia using NSAIDscan significantly reduce the dose of opioid and adversereactions and can be used postoperatively to managemoderate pain after ambulatory surgeryNalbuphine a mixed agonistantagonist opioid is associated with milder μ receptorrelated side effects Itsplasma halflife is  h and in clinical studies the durationof analgesic activity ranges from  to  h [] In ourstudy the VAS at rest of group E was less than  pointsand the difference was statistically significant comparedwith the VAS at rest before administration This indicates that nalbuphine could effectively relieve pain afterambulatory surgery Similar results were also observedin animal studies that showed amelioration of somaticand visceral pain in mice after treatment with nalbuphine []In the present study the VAS at rest at timepoints T1to T4 of the nalbuphine group group E did not differfrom that of the control At T5 the VAS at rest of thenalbuphine group was significantly lower than that ofthe tramadol group This indicates that the duration ofnalbuphine for pain relief after ambulatory surgery waslonger than that of tramadol There were  cases of adverse reactions in the nalbuphine group which wasnot significantly different from the  cases  in thetramadol groupThe incidence of adverse reactions associated with nalbuphine is relatively low compared with other opioidmedications A metaanalysis of randomized controlledtrials by Zeng  [] showed that nalbuphine hassimilar analgesic effects compared to morphine and abetter drug safety profile with a low incidence of postoperative pruritusrespiratory inhibition nausea andvomiting In addition studies have reported that antagonism of the μ receptor by nalbuphine could reduce theadverse reactions of other opioids as seen in the combination of morphine and nalbuphine in patientcontrolled analgesia or patientcontrolled epidural analgesia [ ] and the rate of adverse effects such asurinary retention related to morphine pruritus and nausea was significantly less Nalbuphine with sufentanilused in patientcontrolled analgesia could reduce the 0cGuan  BMC Anesthesiology            Page  of incidence of opioidrelated nausea and vomiting and improved patients� satisfaction with analgesia [ ]In the present study the difference in respiratoryrates before and after administration in both the nalbuphine and tramadol groups was not statistically significant and no respiratory depression was observedMany studies have reported that respiratory depression caused by nalbuphine is small and has a ceilingeffect [ ] In one study a neonate was wronglyadministered a tenfold higher dose than required ofnalbuphine and it resulted in only prolonged sedationwith no respiratory failure []studyIn the presentStudies have shown that preanesthetic injections ofnalbuphine could reduce stress responses and fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate during intubation [ ]the bloodpressures and heart rates of both groups after administration were significantly lower than at T1 althoughstill within normal ranges The blood pressure at T0Inception of the study was compared to the bloodpressure after surgery T1T5 the blood pressure atT1 was significantly higher than at T0 However atthe later timepoints T2 to T5 there were no statistical differences in the blood pressures compared toT0 The decrease in blood pressure after administration T2T5 may have been due to the alleviation ofpain If sothen the lowered blood pressure couldalso indicate the analgesic efficacy of nalbuphineThere are several limitations in this study First a limited number of parameters VAS score adverse eventsand change of vital signs were observed within the halflife of the medication Secondly the VAS scores were recorded at rest and not during movement Finally due toethical issues a placebo control group was not possibleTherefore we were not able to assess the effectiveness ofnalbuphine or tramadol at  and  h after administration Fortunately none of the patients dropped out during the  or  h after administration of medication forpain However the present results warrant further experiments to determine comprehensively the effectiveness and safety of nalbuphine for the treatment of painafter ambulatory surgeryConclusionThis study indicates that nalbuphine at a recommendeddose of  mgkg is safe and effective for pain management after ambulatory surgeryAcknowledgementsNot applicableAuthors� contributionsGYJ This author contributed to the data

Thus our case drawsattention to the fact that SIBO can be an overlookedcause of poor wound healing during the treatment ofpressure soresSIBO was first reported by Vantrappen  as an increased concentration of 14CO2 in a bile acid breath testfor patients with an absent interdigestive motor complex[] Today consensus diagnostic criteria for SIBO arethe presence of more than  �  CFUmL of bacteriaor any amount of E coli in the proximal small bowelcontent [] Relatively little is known about commensalsinhabiting the small intestine mainly due to the limitedaccessibility of this environment for microbiological analysis [] In the healthy state the numbers of intestinalbacteria range from  to  CFUmL and mainly include gramnegative and grampositive aerobes such asStreptococcus Lactobacillus and Bacteroidesspecies[] Regarding the amount of bacteria in proximal jejunal aspiration Khoshini  report that normal subexceed  �  CFUmL and thereforejectsproposed more than  �  CFUmL coliform bacteriaas the threshold for SIBO [] In our case  CFUmLE coli existed in duodenal content and  CFUmL Ecoli existed in gastric content which met the traditionaldiagnostic criteria of SIBOrarelyOther diagnostic methods for SIBO are breath testsusing hydrogen or hydrogen methane with lactulose lucose [] Breath tests have clinical utility for diagnosing SIBO because they are less invasive than obtaining proximal small bowel content However there areno standardized criteria for diagnosing SIBO usingbreath tests [] We did not perform a breath test inour case studyDespite no previous reports of an association betweenunhealed pressure sores and SIBO nutritional status isknown to be important for the healing of pressure sores []In our case the sacral pressure sore which was

level due to SCI is another possible cause of SIBO in our case as well as decreased physical activity due to fracture ofthe lefthumerus and bilateral tibiaChronic gastrointestinalinvolvement is seen in � of patients with SCI [  ] SCI patients lackcentral nervous system control over the gastrointestinalsystem [] Liu  report that bowel problems in SCIpatients are related to high levels of cord injury completeness of cord injury and postinjury durations of years or more [] Moderate or severe grade depressivestatus is also associated with neurologic bowel dysfunction in SCI patients Of these risk factors our patienthad complete cord injury that had occurred more than years ago Also many bowel symptoms appear in patients with SCI eg constipation distension incontinence abdominal pain bowel accidents nausea diarrheastrainingautonomichyperreflexia headaches or sweat relieved by a bowelmovement [  �] However our patient showedno appetite loss a sufficient amount of food intake andnonsevere bowel symptoms Thus the presence of malnutrition despite adequate food intake and low levels oflipidsoluble vitamins that were unresponsive to supplementation led us to suspect SIBOrectal bleeding hemorrhoidsAlthough gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SCI there are few reports ofSIBO in SCI patients Cheng  report that  of  of SCI patients were diagnosed with SIBO basedon the glucose hydrogenmethane breath test [] However the prevalence of SIBO among SCI patients as confirmed by the consensus diagnostic criteria ofthepresence of more than  CFUmL bacteria or anyamount of E coli in upper digestive tract content is unknown In patients with SCI absent central nervous system innervation of the digestive tract can change theinhabiting environment of bacteria Gungor  reportdifferences in gut microbial patterns between SCI patients and control individuals as measured by bacterialgenome sequencing [] Specifically they found thatbutyrateproducing bacteria were specifically reduced inSCI patients Thus it is possible that SIBO is overlookedin patients with SCI In our caseit is unclear whenSIBO occurred relative to the time of SCI but we suspect that it arose due to gastrointestinal motility disorder caused by autonomic disturbancesDisturbances in fat absorption and deficiency in fatsoluble vitamins ie vitamins A K E and D3 areobserved in patients with SIBO [] Excess bacteria inthe small intestine promotes a change from conjugatedbile acid into deconjugated bile acid which decreasesthe micellar solubilization of dietary fat Bacterial fermented short chain fatty acid causes osmotic watermovement to the intestinal lumen which results in diarrhea and malabsorption [] Intestinal epithelial damagein SIBO also interferes with fat absorption Mucosaldamage is caused by metabolites of aerobic bacteria endotoxins of anaerobic bacteria and lithocholic acidwhich is a bacterial degradation product of unconjugatedbile acid [�] Our patient however showed constipation rather than diarrhea in spite of SIBO Whether ornot diarrhea occurs in patients with SIBO is determinedby multiple factors Constipation frequently occurs inpatients with SCI due to decreased physical activity andautonomic dysfunction De Looze  reported that therate of constipation in the patients with SCI is  []A certain proportion of the patients with SCI show constipation in spite of the coexisting SIBO Cheng  reported that in patients with both SCI and SIBO showed constipation [] We believe that the factorsleading to constipation in our patient were stronger thanthose leading to diarrhea Vitamin D deficiency in SIBOcauses osteomalacia Our patientshowed multiplefractures and osteoporosis with serum vitamin D3 levelsbelow thetosupplementationrefractorydetectionlimitandThere is no consensus on the choice dose or durationof antibiotics for treating SIBO [] In principle antibiotics should be chosen based on the results of an antimicrobial susceptibility test but this approach cannotaddress the great diversity in microbiota of the digestivetract [ ] Metronidazole is a firstline choice forSIBO [] with other choices being rifaximin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin amoxicillinclavulanate trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole cephalexin or their combination []However these antibodies are selected based on customrather than scientific evidence [] In our case we usedoral polymyxin B and amphotericin B in accordancewith SDD which was first reported as a method of preventing ventilationassociated pneumonia and microbialtranslocation of gramnegative rod bacteria and fungi incritically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit[�] Polymyxin B administered to the digestive tractis nonabsorbent into the human body and has strongbactericidal power against gramnegative rod bacteriaexcept for naturally polymyxinresistant bacteria such asProteus Providencia Manella Burkholderia and Serratia [] Amphoteric B is an antifungal drug that isalso nonabsorbent into the human body when administered to the digestive tract In our case after startingSDD fatsoluble vitamins were increased and osteoporosis was improved No obvious

patients with SIBO are difficult problemsFew reports are available for the method and timingfor making a decision to stop antibiotherapy in SIBOLauritano  reported that the recurrence rate at months after stopping antibiotherapy in SIBO patientsis  [] They also showed that an older age history of appendectomy and chronic use of PPIs areassociated with SIBO recurrence Bures  reportedthat cyclical gastrointestinal selective antibiotics areneeded for SIBO treatment [] These reports indicatethat in many patients with SIBO it is actually impossible to stop antibiotherapy because of the underlyingconditions that lead to SIBO Similarly in our case itwas difficult to ameliorate the underlying condition ofdecreased motility of the digestive tract due to SCIWe were compelled to continue SDD for a long duration We did however succeed in gradually reducingthe dose of polymyxin B and end the use of amphotericin B without signs of SIBO recurrence Withcareful consideration it may be possible and feasibleto stop SDD completelyProbiotics are also a treatment approach for SIBO assome species of bacteria are thought to protect againsthigh numbers of E coli and fungi in the digestive tract[] However the role and effects of probiotics are stillunclear The digestive tract microbiome has both pathogenic potential and a protective role in maintaininghealth However metagenomic analysis reveals that � of microanisms in the digestive tract cannot becultured under laboratory conditions [] The effects ofSDD and probiotics on the digestive tract microbiome inpatients with SIBO should be investigated to furtherunderstand the pathogenesis of the diseaseIn conclusion we treated a patient with a sacral pressure sore who also had SCI multiple fractures withosteoporosis and malabsorption especially of fatsolublevitamins Based on culture of upper digestive tract content we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and startedSDD using polymyxin B and amphotericin B which effectively ameliorated the absorbency disturbance andallowed healing of the pressure sore In light of severalcommon risk factors between pressure sores and SIBOsuch as decreased physical activity our case providesadditional

neithermeasure of morbidity is completely reliable and wesuggest that researchers may require multiplemeasures selfreport and medicationbased measures of morbidity to fully capture accurate prevalence estimates of multimorbidity Our study identified several limitations of thecurrent versions of the RxRisk indices which require updating if medicationbased measures ofmorbidity are to be used to assess the epidemiologyof chronic conditions and multimorbiditytheofIndeedattentionBackgroundMultimorbidity is commonly defined as the presence oftwo or more chronic medical conditions and its prevalence has been shown to increase with age [] As theworld�s older population continues to grow multimorbidity has become an important public health issue caphealthcareturingresearchersprofessionals as well as policy makersforhealthcare systems to effectively adapt and manage thedelivery of healthcare to our growing older populationan accurate description of the epidemiology of chronicconditions is required However to date studies in theliterature reveal wide disparities in prevalence estimatesof multimorbidity ranging from  to  [ ] Thislarge variability is thought to be due to the lack of standards defining multimorbidity and validated methods forhow it should be measured [] A recent systematic review reported  definitions of multimorbidity involving  differenttheappropriateness of different measures of multimorbidityis also variable depending on both the outcome of interest as well as the type of data that is available []In additioncriteria[]Measures of multimorbidity include diagnosisbasedmeasures eg Charlson Index based on hospital diagnosis codes ICD codes [] medicationbased measureseg RxRisk and RxRiskV for those aged �� yearsbased on pharmacy data [] and patient selfreportDiagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity are themost common measures and are generally based on hospital or physician records [] Medicationbased measures of multimorbidity include the RxRisk and RxRiskV � two algorithms which determine an individual�scurrent comorbidities based on their dispensed medication The RxRisk indexes only include morbidities forwhich a medicine could be prescribed and include categories of morbidities based on the World Health anisation WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Classification ATC system [�] The RxRisk and RxRiskVhave good reliability and criterion validity against ICD9diagnoses and have been shown to predict costs of caremortality and health care utilisation [] Previous studies have reported medicationbased measures of morbidity such as the Medicines Disease Burden Index MDBIand RxRiskV to be useful in epidemiological studieswhen adjusting for comorbidity [] However there arefew studies describing the use of these indices to directlymeasure chronic conditions Patient selfreport is also avalid method of identifying disease categories A study ofolder patients with multimorbidity reported good agreement between patient selfreport and general practitioner GP report for a wide range of diseases []A number of studies have compared the differentmeasures of multimorbidity with differing results [ ] A study of older primary care patients inIreland found that medicationbased measures ofmultimorbidity such as RxRiskV performed betterthan diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity inpredicting emergency and ambulatory care sensitiveACS admissions [] Studies comparing patientselfreport and diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity have reported a stronger association between selfreport measures of multimorbidity andqualitythandiagnosisbased measures [ ] However no previous research has compared selfreported morbidityin the primary care or community setting with theRxRisk measures of morbidity Comparison betweenselfreported morbidity data and pharmacy records isimportant in order to understand the relative meritsof each measure of morbidity and the potential formisclassification particularly in the community setting where access to medical or clinical data can belimitedfunctionaloutcomesandlifeofStudies have also indicated that agreement betweenselfreport measures and other measures of morbiditymight be influenced by patient recall bias [] Patientrecall has been reported to be influenced by age maritalstatus and education [] There is also some evidencethat cognition and memory influence patient recall []The impact of these factors needs to be explored furtherwhen assessing and comparing measures of morbidityThe aim of this study was to  compare the agreementbetween patient selfreported morbidity and medicationbased morbidity RxRisk and RxRiskV and  examine potential patientlevel predictors of discordance between

therapeutic decision is required to assess the balance of benefits and risks of performing or not performing specificoncologic interventions taking cancerspecific mortalityinto consideration Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate overall survival notably at  months with the Carey and Walter indexes [ ] These two scores consider dependency comorbidities with cancer and malnutrition Walter

an inclusive term used to describe a numberof neurological conditions resulting in cognitive impairment and can include Alzheimer�s Disease senile dementia frontotemporal dementia vascular dementia LewyBody dementia Korsakoff syndrome alcohol related braininjury and younger onset dementia [�] Globally thenumber of individuals with a formal dementia diagnosisrose from  million in  to  million in  []A further  million new cases of dementia worldwideare predicted each year [] as populations around theglobe continue to live longer [] These figures could bevery much under estimated as it is widely accepted thatbetween  and  of people affected have no formaldementia diagnosis [] This growing epidemic effects notonly the individuals living with dementia but also theirfamilies caring for them the communities they live in andthe health care systems they rely uponFamily or friends are often key informal caregivers forpeople living with dementia [ ] Globally over billion hours ofinformal care is provided to peopleliving with dementia [ ] Whilst providing this carecan be highly rewarding it has also been described as achronic stressor with caregivers reporting low qualityand quantity of sleep [] and high levels of stress anddepression [] In fact sleep disruption is prevalentamongst dementia caregivers with over  of caregiversexperiencing sleep disturbances []The National Sleep Foundation recommend that olderadults �� years require seven to  h sleep for optimalphysical and psychological wellbeing [] Yet numerousstudies have illustrated that dementia caregivers sleepsignificantly less than that with estimates reporting mostcaregivers sleep less than  h per night [] Not only arecaregivers sleeping less than they should the sleep theydo get is of significantly lower quality than their noncaregiver counterparts []Poor sleep is associated with a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes including hypertensionobesity mood disorders and dementia [] A disruptedsleep pattern is also recognised as a significant factor inpredicting caregiver strain [ ] and perhaps more importantly in predicting placing an individual into long termcare [] Enabling people living with dementia to stay athome rather than transfer to longterm care is the optimaloutcome for many families However this cannot be to thedetriment of the caregiver�s own physical andor psychological wellbeing Therefore in order to support the personliving with dementia PLWD to remain in the communitymaintaining caregiver health is vital Given the pivotal rolesleep has in a myriad of physiological processes it is essential to optimise and preserve caregivers sleepDespite the important role sleep plays in dementiacaregiver health it remains an understudied populationparticularly within the Australian context In fact arecent report by Carers Australia  identified noAustralian studies on sleep disruption in dementia caregivers Only sixteen international studies were identifiedwhich subjectively measured sleep in the dementiacaregivers population with the majority of studies notreporting on the causes or consequences of disturbedsleep []In order to address this paucity of Australian data thepurpose of this study was to elucidate the sleep characteristics and disturbances of Australian caregivers ofPLWD Furthermore this study will determine whetherthere is a relationship between sleep and psychologicalwellbeing among caregivers of communitydwellingpeople living with dementia Lastly we will aim to identify significant predictors of poor sleep which in turncould offer a therapeutic target of poor sleep in dementia caregiversMethodsRecruitmentThis study used a crosssectional descriptive correlationdesign One hundred and four  informal caregiversof

stress  and  respectivelyand  reported anxiety These findings are in keepingwith that of a recent study of dementia caregivers in ruralVictoria where  of caregivers reported depression orstress and  reported anxiety []Previous work has identified an association betweendepression and poor sleep among dementia caregivers[ ] Reduced quality of sleep and depression arehigher among caregivers of people living with dementia[] Furthermore caregivers of people living withdementia who were also depressed experience a greatervariation in sleep patterns []This study reveals sleep scores were

poorsleep overnight respite was only used by  of participants which is in keeping with previous research thatcites  of Australian caregivers have never usedrespite services [] Access to respite care remains oneof the major means of easing caregiver burden and is 0cSmyth  BMC Geriatrics            Page  of frequently identified as needed by caregivers yet remainsunderutilised Whilst a high proportion of dementiacaregivers report a need for respite services there isinsufficient awareness of and access to respite servicesfor caregivers [] Respite service availability can beinvaluable with caregivers reporting lower stress levelsand improved health after use [] Sleep disturbanceshave also been shown to be partially reversed for caregiversduring periods of respite care [] perhaps due to reversalof hyper stressed state Respite services have been cited asan important measure to allow caregivers time to attend totheir own health imperative to supporting the caregiver tocontinue in providing care for their loved one []A recent Australian parliamentary inquiry into sleephealth identified sleep as a foundation of positive healthand wellbeing alongside diet and exercise [] Furthermore the report urged government to prioritise sleephealth as a national priority given its pivotal role inmaintaining health It is clear that caregivers of PLWDhave suboptimal sleep which is associated with poorerpsychological wellbeing and potential increased risk ofdeveloping chronic health conditions such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease [] Interestingly cardiovascular disease and endocrine disease such as diabeteswere the most prevalent comorbidities in our studypopulation Previous studies have also identified highblood pressure diabetes and arthritis as the most prevalent chronic disease in the dementia caregiver groupwhich is in keeping with our findings []Managing sleep and its associated mediators will havedirect impact on both the caregiver�s own health as wellas the caregiver care recipient relationship It is imperative to provide educational support around sleep considerpractical interventions such as overnight respite and toaddress stress management interventions for caregivers inturn reinstating and preserving sleep of this critical population of informal caregiversLimitationsA limitation of this study was the small sample size despitenumerous attempts to recruit participants and involvementof national anisations Although over  participantsprovided demographic details only  participants completed all questionnaires and were included in statisticalanalyses Challenges related to recruiting caregivers andparticularly caregivers of people living with dementia hasbeen described in numerous publications [   ]Caregivers of people with dementia living in the community are more likely to be female and this was representedin our population Furthermore caregivers who are underthe greatest stress may also be those least likely to participate However this remains one of the larger studies ofAustralian dementia caregivers sleep Another limitationwithin this study was that no data was collected regardingthe severity of dementia or behavioural disturbances whichmay impact sleep of the caregiverConclusionSleep problems are widespread within the population ofdementia caregivers Given that the majority of peopleliving with dementia are reliant on family caregiversminimising health and psychologicalimpact on caregivers should be of major concern Furthermore sleepquality is correlated with emotional distress in dementiacaregivers so improving the sleep of caregivers may inturn improve their psychological wellbeing Converselystress is a significant predictor of poor sleep so managing stress may have a positive impact on sleepDementia caregivers are often older with coexistingmorbidities and high levels of psychological distress Withprolonged caregiving and the progression of dementia ofthe care recipient there is the potential for a concurrent decline in the caregivers mental and physical health In orderto support the caregiver in their role it is of the upmost importance that we promote and maximises their health andwellbeing By managing and minimising the negative factorsassociated with caregiving we can enhance caregiving satisfaction and gratification In turn this can ensure optimalcaregivercare recipient relationship supporting the personliving with dementia to remain at home as long as possibleAbbreviationsDASS21 Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale21 PLWD

� with an especially higher rate in the elderly population [] Glioma accounts for approximately  of allcentral nervous system CNS tumors and  of malignant primary brain tumors [] According to the World Health anization WHO classification of tumors ofthe CNS gliomas were classified into fourgrades WHO grade I to IV based on histologic criteria[] WHO grades I and II gliomas are recognized as lowgrade gliomas LGG and grades III and IV are considered highgrade gliomas HGG [] In particular glioblastoma GBM WHO grade IV is the most commonmalignant tumor of the CNS accounting for  ofprimary malignant the CNS tumors and  of all gliomas [] The median survival of GBM patients is approximately  months even after receiving multimodaltherapies that include maximal surgical resection withthe preservation of neurological functions followed byadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy []Gliomas can occur at any age with various incidencesat different ages as reported in populationbased studies[  ] LGG is the most common brain tumor in children while HGG is the most frequent brain tumor inadults [] Tumors in the supratentorial areas of thebrain cerebral hemispheres and midline structuresabove the tentorium were most frequent in adults whilesubtentorial brainstem and cerebellum tumors weremore common in young children than in adolescentsand adults [] Besides increasing studies have assessedage a prognostic factor There are differences in prognosis among patients of different ages even with the samediagnosis A singlecenter review of  patients withintracranial anaplastic oligodendroglioma showed thatthe median survival time of patients younger than years old was significantly longer than that of patientsolder than  years old [] Other studies have shownthat age was an important prognostic factor in additionto KPS score surgical scope and histology [ ]Therefore for patients diagnosed with glioma by imaging examination and auxiliary examination it is necessary to consider the age of the patients to performpersonalized treatment for better outcomesHowever there is no uniform age criterion for groupingglioma patients for personalized treatment [] Some glioma patient cohorts were divided into different age groupsaccording to fixed age intervals [] some were dividedinto two groups based on a certain age point [] andothers were divided based on the overall survival OS ofthe patients [] Different criteria for age grouping haveled to inconsistent s regarding the prognosticvalue of age Some studies showed that age was not aprognostic factor in patients with glioma [ ] whileanother populationbased glioblastoma study with five agegroups   years � years � years � yearsand   years showed that the OS of young patients  years was significantly longer than that for elderly patients   years median  months vs  months p  [] Agerelated studies involving a large numberof glioma patients have yielded some relevant results [] but the age grouping criteria for these studies are influenced by several clinical factors such as the tendencyof clinical researchers Therefore there is an urgent needto establish a more appropriate age group classificationcriterion for better management of glioma patientsFor this purpose we conducted a retrospective studycollecting clinical data from  patients with histologically proven gliomas in Nanfang Hospital between and

heterogeneity across the four agegroups Supplementary Figure S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9S10 S11 Supplementary Table S4S5DiscussionClinical and biological data clearly indicate thatthecharacteristics and outcomes of malignant gliomas differsignificantly between adults and children [] A numberof studies have showed that the tumorprone locationshistopathology prognosis and some molecular markersare different in glioma patients of different ages [ ]Growing research has shown that the molecular characteristics of GBM in elderly patients are more aggressivethan those in young patients [] Childhood

prognosis of glioma is particularly severe in older adults [ ] The clinical practicepatterns show that with increasing age the applicationof surgical resection radiotherapy and chemotherapy decreases [�] Nevertheless some elderly patients withglioblastoma can benefitfrom these therapies []These elderly patients will receive aggressive treatmentwith radiation or chemotherapy When consideringtreatment options for children with gliomas neurosurgeons will try to avoid the deleterious effects of radiotherapy on the developing brains of children Minimaldysfunction resulting from glioma and treatment shouldbe achieved as much as possible with the expectation ofchildren living to adulthood [] Moreover age isregarded as an important factor related to the prognosisof glioma patients Thereforefor patients diagnosedwith glioma age should be taken into consideration toperform personalized treatment for a better outcomeHowever the criterion for appropriately dividing agegroups of glioma patients remains an unresolved clinicalproblemA large number of studies used different age groupings and these studies led us to differential sabout the prognosis value of age in glioma patients [ ] These contradictory s could be partlyexplained by the difference in age classification criteriabetween different studies In one study a multivariateCox regression model with different cutoff points wasused to analyze the effect of age on OS but only threeage groups were compared and univariate analysis wasperformed using prognostic factors as a classification criterion [] OS is a good indicator for evaluating patientoutcomes but confounding factors such as tumor sizetumor location surgical resection extent and patientcompliance might impair the accuracy of the relationship between age and OSTo avoid the disturbance of confounding factors asmuch as possible our study used the WHO grade of glioma as a dependent variable to assess the prognosis ofglioma patients The classification criteria for glioma patients based on age were � years old pediatric groupand � years old youth group � years oldmiddleaged group and ��  years old elderly groupThis age group classification can be used for preliminaryevaluation of newlydiagnosed glioma patients and helpsto perform precise management in clinical practice according to age group Besides we found that EGFRpositive expression was more common in the middleage group and the EGFR expression in IDH1mut gliomas was more apparent Therefore patients withIDH1mut glioma aged � years old might benefitfrom EGFR inhibitor therapy Based on this age groupclassification we further analyzed the characteristics ofWHO grade tumor size tumor histology and anatomical location among the four age groups We found thatthe proportion of WHO grade IV gliomas and positiveexpression of Ki67 Oligo2 and IDHwt increased significantly in elderly age groups In addition in the olderage group more patients suffered from a heavy tumorburden tumor size   cm Regarding the histology ofglioma pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common inchildren while glioblastoma accounts for the largest proportion of adult groups Many studies have demonstrated that patients with a higher grade of glioma havea worse outcome [] Moreover a larger tumor burdenmight cause a higher risk of functional deficits includingmotor dysfunction impaired communication ability ordecline in neurocognitive function [] Therefore theprognosis of patients with gliomas can initially be evaluated according to age On the other hand patientsgrouping according to age has been widely used in clinical studies but there is no uniform standard of agegroup classification for patients with glioma The agegroup established on the basis of objective pathologicaldiagnosis in this study will be helpful for clinical trialsdesign in the futureGlioma especially glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy In addition to the marked heterogeneity of tumor size and histopathology the heterogeneityof the molecular characteristics of tumors is becomingincreasingly important and is reported in several studiesAccording to the  WHO classification glioma isfirst classified according to histologicalfeatures andthen more subtypes are classified according to molecularcharacteristics There are a variety of indicators that arewidely used in clinical practice such as GFAP EMAMGMT P53 NeuN Oligo2 EGFR VEGF IDH1 Ki671p19q and these indicators are highly correlated withthe prognosis of the patients [�] Agedependentoccurrence and the effects of different biological markershave been reported in malignancies [] For examplethe association between age and tumor grade Ki67markers apoptosis index EGFR expression and erbB2expression has been reported in breast cancer [] Astudy indicated that the prognostic effects of P53 1pand CDKN2Ap16 alterations are dependent on patientage [] Increasing translational studies have significantly advanced the understanding of glioma pathogenesis and have identified several prognostic factorsHigher tumor grade older age [] and increased expression of molecular biomarkers such as P53 []MGMT [] PR []

the results were generally consistent between these two subcomponents The associations tend to be more pronounced in 25OHD2 than in25OHD3 and mightindicate the prominence of25OHD2 over 25OHD3 for the prevention of relateddiseases This theory merits further confirmation Nevertheless our results and others provide further evidencefor the importance of a better early vitamin D status forthe prevention of GDM cesarean section preterm birthand low birth weight in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency Our results indicated thatmore consideration should be given to distinguishing between the vitamin D subcomponents women pregnantat different ages and women with more pregnancy complications in this field Considering the high prevalenceof vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy observed inChina [ ] it is a matter of urgency to call for the supplementation of vitamin D and more efforts should bemade to improve the gestational vitamin D status ofChinese populationVitamin D deficiency was found to decrease vasculardiameter within the labyrinth region and dysregulateplacental development during early pregnancy in an animal experiment [] Vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy might rescue this situation while furthersupplementation might be futile after missing this timepoint [] Moreover vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy is likely to affect genetic information ofsystemic inflammation and immune responses involvedin the development of gestational comorbidities egGDM preeclampsia and infection as reviewed by Hollis [] These mechanisms help to explain the beneficialinfluences of vitamin D for maternal and infanthealth and emphasize the importance of improving vitamin D status during early pregnancyOurstudy had several advantages Firstserum25OHD concentrations were measured during an earlygestational period and with the retrospective cohort design we assured the temporal sequence and avoided thepossibility of causal inversion Second we studied multiple outcomes and conducted further analysis of thesubcomponent of vitamin D and a stratified analysis ofgestational age which provided a more comprehensiveunderstanding of this field There are also several limitations of our study First our study was limited by thelack of information on dietary vitamin D intake including by supplement and sunlight exposure during thepregnancy period The obtained data were difficult touse for a retrospective study while the use of blood indicators might be more precise than a dietary survey sowe adjusted the association for different seasons to attenuate their influence Second the 25OHD concentration was measured only once we could not monitor thedynamic changes afterward or determine whether theywere normalized after receiving vitamin D supplementation However the associations tended to be underestimated instead of overestimated Third Wagner et al[] and Mirzakhani  [] indicated a 25OHDconcentration ��  nmolL in early pregnancy was optimal for the prevention of preterm birth and preeclampsia however the highest 25OHD concentration in ourstudy is only  nmolL Therefore we were unable toperform the analyses using a threshold of  nmolLand assess the influences of higher 25OHD concentrations Finally residual confounding might still existthough we tried to control several potential covariatesConclusionsThis retrospective cohort study showed the beneficial associations of early gestational vitamin D with outcomesof GDM cesarean section preterm birth and low birthweight

prostate cancer manifests as a dominatingcause of malerelated death worldwide and is characterized as the most continually occurred tumor amongmen in the United States [] The biggest challenge isthe detectable bone metastases in roughly  advancedprostate cancer [] Virtually all prostate cancer patientsduring  years� androgen deprivation treatment inevitably undergo castrationresistance which contributes tothe poor clinical consequences in prostate cancer []However the mechanism underlaid prostate cancer remains mostly unknownThe widely studied long noncoding RNAs lncRNAsare transcribed from nonproteincoding human genomeand have more than  nt in length [] LncRNAs are increasingly functionally identified and experimentally consolidated to be related to tumor neoplasia and progressionin diverse cancers [] Additionally lncRNAs with dysregulation can functionally modulate tumor developmentfrom multiple pathological aspects such as cell proliferation drugresistance and metastasis [�] For examplelncRNA A1BGAS1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasionin hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting miR216a5p []LncRNA LOC730100 sponges miR760 from FOXA1 toaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion in glioma []LncRNA SNHG16 functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [] Long intergenic nonprotein codingRNA  LINC00992 is a novel lncRNA that has beenpreviously revealed to be elevated in tumors and substantiated as a master regulator for chemoresistance [] Besides LINC00992 has been uncovered as an elevatedlncRNA in prostate cancer [] which is consistent withthe detection from GEPIA database Despite that no previous study has given a comprehensive explanation aboutthe precise function or detailed mechanism of LINC00992in prostate cancerIn past decades the fact that lncRNAs function in tumors depending on their secondary or tertiary structureshas been reported in many cancerlinked studies For instance in the nucleus lncRNAs are entitled to work asmolecular scaffolds or alternative splicing assistants [] On the contrary lncRNAs dispersing in cytoplasm influence downstream mRNA translation or degradationthrough serving as miRNA sponges [ ] For exampleTNFαinduced lncRNA LOC105374902 promotes themalignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells by acting as asponge of miR12853p [] LncRNA TTNAS1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer tumorigenesis by regulatingmiR1533pZNRF2 axis[] Nevertheless whetherLINC00992 could exert its functions in prostate cancer viaits sponging role of certain miRNA remains unknownWe conducted this research aiming to explore thefunction or probable mechanism of LINC00992 in prostate tumor which might enrich the understanding interms of prostate tumor pathology and contribute to awider applied scopeMethodsTissue

prognostic biomarkers for osteosarcoma patients and two nomograms were developed for predicting the OS and DFS of osteosarcoma patientsrespectivelyIn recent years an increasing number of studiesfocused on the carcinogenesis and progression of tumorsbased on the TME and the ESTIMATE algorithm is oneof the most important quantitative tools for this researchfield Based on the ESTIMATE algorithm the association between the prognosis and TME has been initially 0cHu  BMC Cancer            Page  of elucidated in some tumors such as cervical squamouscell carcinoma gastric cancer cutaneous melanomaacute myeloid leukemia bladder cancer and clear cellrenal carcinoma [   �] However previousstudies indicated that TME scores serve as a differentrole in different tumors For example for hepatocellularcarcinoma gastric cancer acute myeloid leukemiabladder cancer and clear cell renal carcinoma patientswith high immune score have a worse prognosis [  �] However for cervical squamous cell carcinoma adrenocortical carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma patients with high immune score have a favorableprognosis [  ] Therefore we can find great heterogeneity among different tumors from the perspectiveof TME For osteosarcoma patients the present studyindicated that patients with higher immune score had abetter OS and DFS Hence the present study indicatedthat immune cells infiltrating tumor tissue may play animportant role in suppressing tumor progressionIn our research  TMErelated genes were identified by comparing the highscore and lowscore osteosarcoma patients The functional enrichment includingGO and KEGG analyses showed that TMErelated geneswere mainly involved in the immune features such asregulation of leukocyte activation MHC protein complex MHC protein and complex binding More importantly the unsupervised cluster analysis based on DEGswas performed and all patients were divided into twoclusters Immune score and T cell CD4 memory activated fraction were significant difference between twoclusters which further elucidated the relationship between DEGs and immune featuresDue to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patientsidentifying robust prognostic biomarker is very importantThe tumor immune microenvironment is closely relatedto the prognosis of bone tumor patients Emilie etal []performed the first genomewide study to describe therole of immune cells in osteosarcoma and found thattumorassociated macrophages are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survivalin highgradeosteosarcoma Recently the prognostic signature based onTMErelated genes have been established for many tumors [  ] but only one study focused on osteosarcoma patients [] Compared with the study performedby Zhang  [] we think that our research have someadvantages Firstly our signatures were established basedon several validated genes and both two signatures weresuccessfully validated in independent cohorts Secondlythe outcome of DFS was not reported in the previousstudy As reported in published studies tumor recurrenceis a terrible medical problem for osteosarcoma patientsand the 5year survival rate for osteosarcoma patients withmetastasis or relapse remains disappointing [ ]Hence the DFS nomogram can improve the managementof osteosarcoma patients Finally two nomograms incorporated TMErelated signature and clinical variables wereestablished in our research which further facilitated theclinical application of our findingsIn our research five genes were incorporated into thefinal prognostic signatures FCGR2B GFAP and MPP7were identified and validated as OSrelated biomarkerswhile CYP2S1 and ICAM3 were DFSrelated biomarkersThe role of these genes in tumor prognosis had beenwidely reported in previous studies [�] FCGR2Bhas been confirmed as an immunerelated gene previously [] Although the relationship between FCGR2Band prognosis in sarcoma patients had not been reported the prognostic value of FCGR2B had been widelyconfirmed in other cancerssuch as hepatocellularcarcinoma and glioblastoma [ ] In addition NewM etal [] demonstrated that MPP7 is novel regulatorsof autophagy which was thought to be responsible forthe prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaCYP2S1 described as Cytochrome P450 Family  Subfamily S Member  was reported significantly associatedwith colorectal cancer In primary colorectal cancerCYP2S1 was present at a significantly higher level ofintensity compared with normal colon [] More importantly the presence of strong CYP2S1 immunoreactivity was associated with poor prognosis [] The roleof ICAM3 in cancer was also widely reported in published studies and the Akt pathway plays an importantrole in the impact of ICAM3 on tumors YG Kim etal[] reported that ICAM3 can induce the proliferationof cancer cells through the PI3KAkt pathway Additionally JK Park etal showed that the ICAM3 can enhancethe migratory and invasive potential of human nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducing MMP2 andMMP9 via Akt pathway [] showed that the ICAM3can enhance the migratory and invasive potential ofhuman nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducingMMP2 and MMP9 via Akt pathwayAlthough the role of TME and TMErelated genes inosteosarcoma patients have been initially studied by bioinformatic and statistical analyses in our research somelimitations should be elucidated Firstly the treatmentinformation cannot be obtained from the TARGET database which may influence the prognosis of osteosarcomapatients Secondly two nomograms were generated andshowed good performance in our study However externalvalidation by a large cohort is needed Thirdly many independent prognostic genes for osteosarcoma patients wereidentified in the present study but the potential mechanism to influence

diagnosticssurgical techniques and treatment have hardly improvedthe survival rate in the past  years The 5year relativesurvival rate as reported by the American Cancer Societyremains only  [ ]Only � of all patients are eligible for surgery todate the only potential cure [] Approximately � ofall patients with pancreatic cancer have metastatic diseaseat diagnosis and  of all patients have locally advanceddisease with tumor involvement of surrounding vessels orans At the time of surgery approximately � ofthe patients are considered unresectable because of unexpected liver metastasis peritoneal carcinomatosis or locally advanced disease [�]More than  of all liver metastases develop in thefirst six months postoperatively [] These liver metastases are most likely already present at the time of diagnosis and have not been identified preoperatively as theyare too small to be detected by routine preoperativeultrasound and contrastenhanced CT CECT [ ]CECT is highly accurate in assessing the relationship ofthe tumor to critical arterial and venous structures sincetheir involvement can preclude surgical resection HoweverCECT has a poor sensitivity � for the detection andcharacterization of liver metastases [ �] especiallyfor subcentimeter metastases which are often present inpancreatic cancer [] This leads to futile surgical treatment with all the associated morbidity mortality and costsMoreover patients who were explored with curative intentand were found unresectable due to peritoneal or liver metastases had a worse overall survival compared to patientswith unexpected locally advanced disease []Nowadays diffusionweighted MR imaging DWI appears to be valuable in both detection and characterizationof focal liver lesions with a high sensitivity � evenfor subcentimeter lesions � [�] This technique can be used to detect and characterize liver lesionsbased on decreased diffusion of water molecules caused bytumoral hypercellularity and reduced extracellular spaceDWI is especially useful for detecting subcentimeter livermetastasesit is more accurate than conventional T2weighted imaging techniques because signal suppression ofintravascular flow is obtained black blood effect whilemaintaining good residual signal of the liver lesions [] Itis easy to implement and adds very little time to a standardMRI examination However without highquality evidenceof the benefit of MRI the use of MRI as part of the routineworkup is questioned and therefore not implemented Currently most guidelines advise to use MRI as a problemsolving tool in addition to CECT eg when the primarytumor cannot be visualized or in case of undefined liver lesions [�] The American Society of Clinical OncologyASCO leaves the choice of imaging modality in the handsof the physician [] MRI is advised for all patients according to the Japanese guideline however the level of evidenceis low grade C []Most studies that have been performed for liver metasincluding our singletases of PDAC are

Inclusion of patients is expected tobe finished December accuracy ofDiscussionThe purpose of the DIAPANC trial is to investigate thediagnosticcontrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI in patients with suspected PDAC for thedetection of liver metastases Additionally we will evaluatewhether performing contrastenhanced diffusionweightedMRI will improve the detection of liver metastases compared to CECT by determining the sensitivity and specificity of CECT for the detection of liver metastasesDespite the good diagnostic performance of MRI forliver metastases the benefits of MRI remain unclearmostly because of low level of evidence heterogeneityand bias in the performed studies Two recently published metaanalyses have suggested the results shouldbe confirmed by performing a welldesigned and sufficiently powered study directly comparing liver CT andMRI in the same cohort [ ]A major difficulty in the interpretation of the currentliterature is that most studies are retrospective oftenonly reporting on a subset of patients actually undergoing a resection patients with borderline resectable tumors or patients with indeterminate liver lesions onCECT These patients have a higher probability of 0cLitjens  BMC Cancer            Page  of having liver metastases However in an era of neoadjuvant therapy local ablative therapy for advanced tumorsexpensive targeted therapies and resection of oligometastases MRI may be beneficial to patients with allstages of PDAC Therefore all patients with suspectedPDAC are eligible for inclusion in the DIAPANCMRI field strength  T versus  T was a significant factor in the heterogeneity between studies that was found ina metaanalysis  T MRI had a higher sensitivity  anda lower specificity  for diagnosing liver metastasiscompared to  T MRI sensitivity  and specificity[] Because the signaltonoise ratio and thelesiontoliver contrast are higher on  T MRI than on T MRI it is reasonable that a  T MRI permits a higher lesion detection rate [ ] In the DIAPANC study weplan to perform all MRIs on a  T scanner A potentialdownside of a multicenter design is the intervendor variability that could occur when comparing the quantitativeApparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC value this variabilityseems to be more pronounced at  T than at  T []Availability of MRI is not expected to be an issue asMRI is available in every expert center for pancreaticdiseases However problems with MRI capacity couldarise due to the need for MRI within a short intervalafter CT A time interval of two weeks was chosen toprovide a feasible time frame for MRI to be performedand no intervallesions are expected within this timeinterval []The DIAPANC trial is the first international prospective multicenter cohort study about the diagnostic accuracyof contrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI On theWorld Health anization trial registry website ICTRPincorporating all inter national trial registries there areonly four other prospective trials registered in this fieldThe first trialis a completed French prospectivemulticenter trial presumably the only one prospective study that has been published [] The studyhas been performed in  patients with potentiallyresectable pancreatic cancer on a  T scanner usinggadobenate dimeglumine MultiHance as contrastagent The study has been performed to assess thediagnostic performance of diffusionweighted MRIfor the preoperative diagnosis of liver metastasis andthe modification of therapeutic strategy as a consequence ofliver metastasis ondiffusionweighted MRI []the diagnosis ofThe second trial is a British single center observational study with a target sample size of  patientswith confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer referred for pancreaticoduodenectomy and is completed recently The primary outcome of this studyis the proportion of patients correctly identified byMRI to have lymph node peritoneal or liver metastases To our knowledge the results have not beenpublished and there is no information on scan parameters and contrast agent available []The third trial from Australia is the only randomizedcontrolled trial The study has a target sample size of patients and is not yet recruiting The aim of the studyis to compare the 12month recurrence rate in patientswith locally operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with standard preoperative assessment of liver metastases with CECT versus preoperative assessment withliver specific contrast MRI []The fourth trial is a Chinese comparative study and isnot yet recruiting The study aims to compare liver specific contrast MRI and CECT in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer with a target sample size of  patients []The DIAPANC trial hypothesizes a superior value ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT To reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy thegold standard is histopathology of the liver lesions Considering it is not always possible and sometimes even unethical to obtain histopathological proof of every lesionfollowup is used as a reference standard Hence we areable to simultaneously gather information on early localrecurrence or metastases after resection disease progression and therapy response evaluation on MRI and CECTIn conclusion the DIAPANC trial is expected to report highlevel evidence of the diagnostic accuracy ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT resulting in significant value for clinical decisionmaking guideline development and improved stratification for treatment strategies and future trials Furthermore

extracts to treat patients with metastatic advanced breastcancer The condition was significantly alleviated sparkinginterest in exploring the relationship between thyroid andbreast cancer [] Subsequently a prospective study enrolled  women and  women with earlier diagnosisof hypothyroidism observed the occurrence of breast cancer during followup showed that low serum free thyroxine levels increased the risk of breast cancer [] In  aprospective women withhypothyroidism and  hyperthyroidism found thathypothyroidism slightly reduced the risk of breast cancer[] However a prospective cohort study of women with autoimmune hypothyroidism and women with normal thyroid function indicated that autoimmune hypothyroidism was not associated with breastcancer risk [] Besides some animal experiments alsoreflect the relationship between the two [ ] Animalexperiments by López Fontanafound thathypothyroidism mice inhibit the development of breastcancer and promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cellsdue to the low expression of βchain protein and activation of the apoptotic pathway on the tumour cell membrane [] Due to the inconsistency ofthe aboveconclusions we performed a metaanalysis to evaluate therelationship between hypothyroidism and breast cancerrisketalA total of  studies were included in this metaanalysis and the results showed that patients withhypothyroidism not related to the risk of breast cancerHowever there was significant heterogeneity among theincluded studies After subgroup analysis and sensitivityanalysis we found that Cristofanilli�s research may causeheterogeneity [] Cristofanilli�s research is a retrospective study and the diagnosis of hypothyroidism patientswas based on the information recorded in the medicalrecords which may lead to the bias risk of misclassification and have a positive impact on the positive results ofthis study [] After excluding Cristofanilli�s researchwe found that patients with hypothyroidism had a lowerrisk of breast cancer with borderline significance [] Theresults of the metaanalysis are inconsistent with the findings of Hardefeldt  and Angelousi  [ ] Perhaps because our study included more prospective studiesand Asian population cohort study In addition we evaluated the risk of breast cancer in thyroid hormone replacement therapy and show that patients who received thyroidhormone replacement therapy was not related to the riskof breast cancerIn the analysis of the European population the resultsshow that hypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breastcancer We also found that patients with hypothyroidismcan reduce the risk of breast cancer was borderline significance in the subgroup with more longer followupdate However the relationship between the two was notobserved in North American and Asian populationsThe possible reasons for these disparities may be as follows First followup time may be the main contributorsto this difference A longer followup is required to demonstrate the relationship between hypothyroidism andbreast cancer risk In the metaanalysis five studies provided North American population data and two reported Asian population data However only one ofseven nonEuropean studies� followup time for morethan  years Second the differences may be attributedto different ethnicities sharing different genegene andgeneenvironmental backgrounds Third social and environmental factors are another critical cause for thisdifference With these in mind our findings suggest thathypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breast canceronly in the European population and more largescalehighqualitylongterm prospective cohort studies arestill needed to study on different human populationsThe following may explain the potential relationshipbetween hypothyroidism and the risk of breast cancerHealthy mammary epithelial cells can express a largenumber of T3 receptors and breast cancer cells have asimilar ability to bind to T3 [] T3 has an estrogenlike effect that promotes the growth of mammary glandlobes and stimulates normal breast tissue differentiation[ ] Therefore T3 can mimic the effect of estrogenon the proliferation of breast cancer cells When theconcentration of T3 is low in vivo it may inhibit theproliferation of breast cancer cells Hypothyroidism mayreduce the risk of breast cancer by affecting T3concentrationSome basic experiments support this theory In GonzalezSancho  studied the relationship betweenT3 and breast cancer [] It was found that there is anoverexpressed T1 gene in human breast cancer cellsand T3 inhibits the proliferation of mammary epithelialcells by inhibiting the expression of cyclin D1 and T1thereby inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells 0cWang  BMC Cancer            Page  of Author

needs to be taken with caution as this study has several limitations First the studies that have been included do not adjust for importantrisk factors for breast cancer Second in subgroup analysis for

of patients exhibit noresponse to PD1 blockade which is considered to beassociated with T cell exclusion or exhaustion or inadequate T cell trafficking and many immunosuppressivefactors accumulate in the tumor microenvironment []New therapy regimens that improve the response andlongterm efficacy are desperately needed The efficacy ofantiPD1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy hasbeen confirmed in nonsmallcell lung cancer [ ] Inaddition to direct tumor killing conventional cytotoxicchemotherapy has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties by enhancing tumor antigenicity disturbing immunesuppressive pathways inducing immunogenic cell deathand increasing effector Tcell reactions [] It is safe tohypothesize that antiPD1 antibodies in combination withchemotherapy may further improve the clinical outcomesof patients with advanced GC Sintilimab is a highly selective monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interactionsbetween PD1 and its ligands with strong antitumorresponse [] A phase 1a study for dose escalation hasdemonstrated the tolerance and pharmacological activity ofsintilimab in patients with advancedstage solid tumors butthere is limited evidence for the

not find a significant relationshipbetween TMB and the response of gastric cancers toPD1 therapy [] The latter data is in accordance withour finding that after treatment with sintilimab in combination

Studieshave shown that overexpression of TROP2 is associatedwith tumorigenesis and malignancy [�]In thisstudy TROP2 expression was observed to be a highlysensitive and specific marker of tongue squamous cellcarcinoma and tissue stiffness The relative thickness ofsamples helped accurately diagnose and determine thestaging of tongue squamous cell carcinomaImmunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of TROP2 in poorly differentiated OSCC tissueswas significantly higher than that in welldifferentiatedOSCC tissues Additionally TROP2 upregulation wascorrelated with tumors of advanced TNM III  IV staging and poor differentiation than that in tumors withlow TNM I  II staging Thus the abnormal expressionof TROP2 may be associated with the occurrence anddevelopment of tongue malignancies Furthermore highTROP2 expression predicted low survival as comparedto that in the tumors with low TROP2 expression Previous research has also demonstrated the correlation between shorter patient lifespan and high levels of TROP2as compared to that in patients with laryngeal squamouscell carcinoma and low levels of TROP2 [] TROP2possesses sites for tyrosineserine phosphorylation thatregulate signal transduction or its expression and activity thereby rendering cancer cells resistant to apoptosis[] Upregulated TROP2 correlates with the poor prognosis of thyroid papillary carcinoma [] colon cancer[] liver cancer [] and other malignanciesThere have been an increasing number of studies on thebiological role of TROP2 at the molecular level TROP2induces the downregulationloss of PTEN thereby stimulating PI3KAKT signaling and tumor development []PTEN is a wellknown tumor suppressor that is a phosphatase [] and affects the PI3KPKBAKT signaling axisduring the dephosphorylation of PIP2 and PIP3 []PI3K signaling is important in regulating tumor cell proliferation migration and invasion [ ] Thus PTEN is anegative regulator of cancer [ ] Li  have shownthat TROP2 activates epithelialmesenchymal transitionvia PI3KAKT signaling thereby promoting proliferationmigration and metastasis in gallbladder cancer [] Similarly TROP2 expression stimulates the proliferation migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells [] Hou et aldemonstrated that TROP2 regulates JAK2STAT3 signaling in glioblastoma cells [] 0cZhang  BMC Cancer            Page  of Fig

proteins with homologous domains such as pleckstrinRAC Tiam and Vav Tiam and Vav activate RAC thatleads to reanization of the actin cytoskeleton cellrecognition and adhesion []The underlying mechanisms involved in the alterationof micromechanical properties of OSCC samples and occurrence development metastasis and invasion ofOSCC tumors remain to be elucidated HE staining isthe gold standard for tumor diagnosis With the development of biomechanics in the past two decades [] the mechanical properties of tissues need to be investigated based on biomedical and physical parametersIn this study we have assayed the changes in mechanicalproperties at the micronanometer level using AFM anddetermined the association between the TNM grademetastasis and stiffness of tumor samplesIn conclusion we have demonstrated the association between differential expression of TROP2 and patient agetumor differentiation tumor size TNM stage percutaneousnerve filtration and vascular invasion Moreover high levelsof TROP2 correlated with poor overall survival in patientsHighly differentiated cancer tissues exhibited increasedsurface roughness and stiffness Lastly high TROP2 expression resulted in reduced tumor stiffness However thisstudy had some limitations First the cohort used in thisstudy was relatively small Second we did not employ molecular methods of analysis such as western blotting orenzymelinked immunosorbent assay Thus using a largerpatient cohort and multiple techniques in molecular andcell biology will help validate our findings and developTROP2 as a specific and efficient prognostic biomarker forOSCCConclusionThese findings could promote new methods for the earlyOSCC diagnosis depend on the stage of cancer and developing screening methods with high sensitivity andspecificity More detailed studies are needed to determine the feasibility and therapeutic benefit of testing tissue stiffness in human diseaseAbbreviationsOSCC Oral squamous cell

uncommon in children compared to adults The prevalence  of  palpable  thyroid  nodules  in  children  ranges  from    to    Sporadic  welldifferentiated thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy in children accounting for  of pediatric cancers  in  the  prepubertal  age  group  and  up  to   of cancers in adolescents aged � year2 The most common indication for thyroid surgery in children varies among published studies but thyroidectomy for malignant conditions is rising38 Data in children throughout the  world  are  relatively  scarce  The  objective  of  this study was to analyze the clinical data and outcome of thyroid  surgery  in  a  large  series  of  children  treated  at a  single  center  at  King  Faisal  Specialist  Hospital  and Research Center KFSHRC in RiyadhPATIENT AND METHODS With the approval of the Institutional Review Board IRB at KFSHRC the medical records of all patients  years old and younger who underwent a thyroid surgery between    and    were  retrospectively  reviewed We elected to include patients up to the year  to ensure a reasonable followup period Patients for the study were identified by a search of the operating room log for all procedures involving the thyroid gland for the specified age groupDemographic  data  clinical  features  and  surgical outcomes  were  collected  Specific  data  that  were  obtained included age at operation gender family history presenting  symptoms  history  of  radiation  exposure presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type  MEN   thyroid  function  test  presence  and  size  of  thyroid nodules by ultrasound presence of lymph nodes metastasis or distant metastasis fine needle aspiration FNA cytology  surgical  procedure  final  histopathology  and length of followup Outcomes analyzed were postoperative complications including transient or permanent hypocalcemia  transient  or  permanent  recurrent  laryngeal nerve paralysis wound infection and hematoma length of stay and radioactive iodine treatment and recurrences Thyroid procedures in this series included hemithyroidectomy  subtotal  total  and  completion  thyroidectomy Surgeries were performed by either an endocrine adult surgeon or a pediatric surgeon No intraoperative nerve monitoring was used Early in the series procedures were performed by adult endocrine surgeons but lately a combined approach was adopted where pediatric surgeons and adult endocrine surgeons collaborated in such cases  proceduresthe normal range in our laboratory regardless of symptoms Transient hypocalcemia was identified if it lasted for less than  months while permanent hypocalcemia was  considered  if  the  serum  calcium  level  remained below normal range and the patient continued on calcium  supplementation  after    months  of  the  surgery All patients with a family history of MEN  underwent genetic testing of the RET protooncogene to confirm the diagnosis All patients who underwent completion thyroidectomy  had  a  preoperative  and  postoperative vocal  cords  assessment  at  the  Otolaryngology  clinic Descriptive data were generated and comparisons were conducted using the t test for continuous data

final  histopathology  in  of cases There were three cases of toxic adenoma and one case of Graves� disease which did not require FNA  The  remaining  cases  underwent  FNA  at  another institution and FNA was not repeated at our institution or they came for completion thyroidectomy with documented  pathology  for  malignancy  after  they  had  their first surgery in another hospitalThe  most

medullary thyroid cancer  so  did  not  receive  RAI  In  the  remaining  five cases  there was no clear data whether those patients received RAI before or only after a recurrence All local recurrences  underwent  resection  except  for  one  patient who was lost follow up There was no mortality in this study DISCUSSIONThe most common indication for thyroidectomy in this series was thyroid nodule which correlates with previously published reports in the pediatric population35 Children with thyroid nodules have an estimated fourfold  higher  risk  of  developing  thyroid  cancer  compared to adults910 The high incidence of malignancy in this series suggests children with a thyroid nodule should be carefully evaluatedFNA is a valuablemethod for preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules However there are limitations on  the  routine  use  of  FNA  in  children  including  the need  for  sedation  sampling  errors  and  the  limited availability  of  experienced  cytopathologists11  Many previous studies reported high sensitivity and specificity of FNA in evaluating thyroid nodule in children1114 which correlate with our findingsOur data showed lymph node metastasis in  of  thyroid  cancer  cases  which  supports  the  notion that  children  with  thyroid  cancer  frequently  present with more extensive disease than adults Lymphnode involvement  at  diagnosis  is  seen  in    to    of children  compared  with    to    of  adults  with differentiated thyroid cancer1523 Because our hospital is the largest referral center in Saudi Arabia especially for oncology cases this may explain the large number of lymph node and distant metastasis In this cohortThe  most  common  complication  reported  after thyroidectomy in children is hypoparathyroidism with an incidence ranging between  to  which original PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0ccorresponds with our results of  which are reported as hypocalcemia in Table    One study found that total thyroidectomy central and bilateral neck dissection Graves� disease and malignancy were  risk  factors  for  hypocalcemia  after  thyroid  surgery3 In this cohort postoperative hypocalcemia was noted more in malignant cases but it failed to reach statistical significance Moreover there was no significant difference between benign and malignant cases in  terms  of  mean  age  gender  distribution  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or overall complications a finding that was reported previously26 Multiple studies in recent years have found an inverse relationship between surgeon volume and complication  rates2728  but  similar  data  in  the  pediatric population is lacking One study found that highvolume  endocrine  surgeons  have  better  outcomes  and shorter lengths of stay and lower costs after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy in children compared to pediatric surgeons general surgeons or otolaryngologists29  Scheumann  and  colleagues  also  concluded that a collaborative approach between pediatric and endocrine surgeons would have better outcomes This has led other authors to suggest that a combined approach with endocrine and pediatric surgeons in addition to pediatric endocrinologists may optimize the care of children with surgical thyroid disease given the low number of pediatric patients4 Our data do not allow for comparisons of different approaches given the late adoption of the combined approach The  recurrence  rate  for  thyroid  cancer  in  children after  thyroidectomy  has  varied  widely  in  reported studies  ranging  from    to    while  it  was   in  this  cohort  Only  a  few  studies  explored  the predictors  of  recurrence  Lymph  node  involvement multiple nodules male gender younger age histologic subtype and advanced tumor stage were risk factors associated with recurrence17233033 In  this  study    of  patients  with  malignant  lesions received RAI Although there are conflicting data regarding  the  indications  of  postoperative  RAI  treatment in lowrisk patients the current recommendation is that lowrisk patients can be treated without RAI3436There are some limitations to this study The retrospective nature may affect the validity and quality of the data The small number of cases in some categories did not enable us to compare groups and explore predictors relative to these factors On the other hand this study adds to the scarce data on thyroid surgery in pediatric age group Malignancy is the commonest indication  for  thyroid  surgery  in  children  and  FNA  is highly  diagnostic  Hypocalcemia  and  recurrent  laryngeal nerve injury are significant complications Cancerrelated  death  is  extremely  rare  but  recurrence  is  not uncommon and a significant number of patients with malignant cases received RAI treatmentoriginal PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0cREFERENCES  Trowbridge  FL

subsets The first query QPub_plain is based on a plaintext search in PubMed titles and s using keywords The  second  query  QPub_indexed relies on the PubMed indexing scheme using MeSH terms and results are made exclusive of the previous set The third one QWoS_restricted is based on a plaintext search in WoS restricted to the two research areas �Medical Informatics� and �Health Care Sciences  Services� The fourth query QWoS_filtered is based on the same plaintext search used in WoS but filtered by nonrelevant research areas eg Archeology Dance Zoology etc and the two research areas of the previous query It is of note that the two WoS queries select  only  nonPubMedindexed  papers that are supposed to be caught by the two PubMed queriesA  first  review  of  the  four  subsets  of

summaries of their contents are available in the AppendixDiscussion and OutlookIn the first paper Hendriks  [] propose an approach to the modeling of clinical practice guidelines which certainly builds on already existing approaches but which is systematically conducted in order to be scalable and used to represent complex guidelines They promote the formalism of clinical decision trees CDTs as they are both clinically interpretable  by  healthcare  professionals and  computerinterpretable  thus  suitable for implementation in datadriven CDSSs The disambiguation of textual guidelines is supported first by the formal unequivocal specification of data items used as decision criteria using international coding systems to enforce interoperability and second by the representation of guideline knowledge as CDTs The method is applied to the Dutch breast cancer guidelines Sixty CDTs were built  involving  a  total  of    data  items among  which    could  not  be  linked  to standard terminologies The authors report the ambiguity of certain criteria which could be subjective or had multiple definitions The resulting knowledge base was implemented in a decision support application where it can be interactively browsed or automatically executed By modeling guidelines in such a way this work is a step forward in the sharing of encoded knowledgeIn the second paper Kamišalić  [] tackled the issues linked to the formalization of the medical processes used for managing chronic diseases and their execution in CDSSs They analyzed the decisionmaking dimensions of the therapeutic management of chronic diseases like those known to increase the cardiovascular risk and identified three basic levels therapy strategy dosage adaptation and intolerance management To handle these  different  aspects  consistently  they propose a formalism called extended Timed Transition Diagram eTTD With eTTDs they illustrate the multilevel and finegrained modeling required to capture the contents of arterial hypertension management guidelines This detailed demonstration on how procedural knowledge for hypertension management can be formalized to develop a CDSS could certainly be used in other medical domainsThe third paper by Khalifa  [] presents a conceptual and practical framework to help assess confidence in predictive tools GRASP  for  Grade  and Assess  Predictive Tools is both a method to look for evidence from the published literature and an analysis grid It standardizes the assessment of the available literature associated to a predictive tool and the grading of its level of proof Three phases of evaluation are considered i before the implementation of the tool to assess both its internal and external validity ii during the implementation to assess its potential effect and usability and iii after the implementation to assess its effectiveness and safety In each phase the level of evidence  can  be  assessed  from  the  study design A qualitative  summarizes the direction of evidence positive negative mixed This grid can be considered as similar to existing grids for instance the CONSORT statement for clinical trials However it gives a rigorous methodology for a critical appraisal of predictive tools and could be extended to all kind of CDSSs It might be a useful tool to extend the evidencebased culture in the field of medical informaticsBesides the three best papers selected for the  Decision  Support section  of  the   edition of the IMIA Yearbook several other works retrieved from the literature review deserve to be cited Some of them deal with the personalization of decisions Laleci   []  propose  a  scientific  and  technical approach to develop personalized care plans that comply with clinical practice guidelines for the management of complex polypathology situations Jafarpour  [] propose a solution to dynamically manage the conflicts that can rise in this type of complex contexts Ben Souissi  [] introduce the use of health  information  technology  involving multiple criteria decision to support the choice between antibiotics alternatives Interestingly other works promote the creation and sharing of operational knowledge bases as exemplified by Hendriks  [] Thus Huibers  [] transform the textual STOPPSTART criteria into unambiguous definitions mapped to  medical  terminologies  Canovas et  al [] formalize EUCAST expert rules as an ontology and production rules to detect antimicrobial therapies at risk of failure M�ller  [] propose an   diagnostic knowledge base that can compete with commercial ones Replacing humans is another topic of research and Spnig  [] work on two aspects to virtualize a doctor the automatic acquisition of data through sensors and speech recognition and the automation of diagnostic reasoning Rozenblum et al[] propose a machine learning method to generate clinically valid alerts to detect errors in prescriptions Acceptability  of  CDSS  is  another  key point Kannan  [] propose a method for a CDSS design to best meet a precisely specified and assessable user purpose Design alerts  may  also  avoid  rejection  of  CDSSs by caregivers Fernandes  [] created algorithms able to aggregate filter and reduce the notifications delivered to healthcare professionals Amrose et  al [] tried to understand in real life the impact of alerts on users and to find the actions they triggered Finally it is always interesting to obtain varied evaluation results of controversial CDSSs In this respect Kim  [] evaluated Watson for Oncology in thyroid carcinoma and reported a concordance rate with local practices considered as too low to adopt the tool As  evidenced  by  the  number  and  the variety of works around decision support research in the field is

narrative and described in large textual documents the aim of this work was to model complex guidelines as datadriven clinical decision trees CDTs that could be still humaninterpretable while computerinterpretable for implementation in decision support systems The Dutch national breast cancer guidelines were translated into CDTs Data items  which  characterize  the  patient  and the tumor

theadventitia8 The intima is built of the layer of endothelial cellson the luminal side the media consists of smooth musclecells and the adventitia forms the outer part8 In a normalsetting the endothelium is crucial for vein integrity andprevention of thrombosis9 and its focal disruption maypredispose to vessel thrombosis2 SV manipulation andimplantation leads to loss of endothelial integrity and elicitsan inﬂammatory response with platelet adhesion and leukocyte recruitment Notwithstanding an overt thrombosis isextremely rare in the operating room SV dissection results inblood ﬂow disruption in vasa vasorum and causes adventitial damage hypoxia and vessel wall hyponutrition10 Acuteperioperative saphenous vein graft failure is almost always aresult of graft thrombosis but this very uncommonly occursprior to graft placement Surgical factorslike technicalanastomotic failure or severe disproportion between thetarget vessel and the graft may lead to thrombosis butvessel injury and hypercoagulability are among potentialcauses as well11There was no evident inﬂammatory process in microscopy inour patient but even if an inﬂammatory process was presentTH  Vol  No

hypothesized that increased thrombin generation and prothrombotic ﬁbrin clot phenotype were responsiblefor the clinical presentation Conversion of ﬁbrinogen to ﬁbrinfacilitated by thrombin is a concluding step of coagulation Ithas been shown that ﬁbrin clots with small pores betweentightly packed thin ﬁbrin ﬁbers are relatively lysis resistant12Such clot phenotype has been evidenced in multiple thromboticpathologies such as myocardial infarction6 ischemic stroke13and venous thromboembolism4 The prothrombotic clotphenotype reﬂected by a tendency to form dense ﬁbrin clotsresistant to lysis has been previously reported in patients withinstent thrombosis14 While routine thrombophilia screeningresults in a high almost  detection rate of commonhypercoagulable states15 there are prothrombotic conditionsthat escape routine diagnostic approach The overall microscopic clot appearance and prothrombotic ﬁbrin properties lead tothe discovery of two mutations in our patient that are notroutinely tested during thrombophilia screening namely ﬁbrinogen 455G  A and FXIII100G  TElevated ﬁbrinogen was postulated as one of the riskfactors for early graft failure after CABG1116 Epidemiologicalstudies have established that elevated ﬁbrinogen is stronglyassociated with cardiovascular diseases17 A  metaanalysis of individual records of  participants from prospective studies revealed that age and sexadjustedhazard ratio per  gL increase in usual ﬁbrinogen level forcoronary heart disease was   conﬁdence interval [CI]� while for stroke the hazard ratio was as high as 95CI � Risk of coronary disease progression wasalso linked to genetic polymorphisms of the ﬁbrinogen geneDe Maat et al found that A allele of ﬁbrinogen 455G  Awas associated with more severe progression of coronarydisease as documented angiographically18 Gu and colleagues in a metaanalysis of  studies with  patientsfound that A allele of the ﬁbrinogen 455G  A is associated with susceptibility to coronary disease and also withischemic stroke odds ratio for stroke �  [ CI �]for AA þ GA vs GG19 In a recent study of patients with atrialﬁbrillation Hu and colleagues found that the A allele of ﬁbrinogen 455G  A was a risk factor for cardioembolicstroke probably by elevating the level of plasma ﬁbrinogen20 On the other hand in a  metaanalysis of studies involving  cases and  controls FXIIIVal34Leu polymorphism was shown to be associated withrisk myocardial infarction21 FXIII is crucial to thrombusstabilization and changes of its plasma concentration reﬂectnonspeciﬁcally the extent of thrombosis as shown by Li et alin a study on patients with cerebral venous thrombosis22Interesting associations of FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism andthrombotic disorders have been reported Jung et al reportedin a metaanalysis of  studies that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss23Although no association with the incidence of ischemicstroke was found for this polymorphism24 apparentlywhen the stroke occurs Val34Leu polymorphism of FXIIIaffects the severity of its outcome25 Furthermore Kreutzand colleagues suggested in  that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism may increase risk of recurrent MI and death inpatients with angiographically established coronary arterydisease26 In  our group has shown in a study of patients that in patients undergoing CABG FXIII Leu34 alleleis associated with decreased ﬁbrin clot permeability andefﬁciency of ﬁbrinolysis27ConclusionOur extensive workup showed that ﬁbrinogen HaeIII andFXIII Val34Leu polymorphisms are reﬂected in reduced clotpermeability and susceptibility to lysis These mutationslikely contributed to intraoperative saphenous graft thrombosis Further studies are needed to elucidate the role ofthese

heat conductionwhich is generated from an oscillatinghighfrequency alternating electric currentproduced by the RFA generator and thentransferred through the electrode tip Theenergy of RFA is powerful and accurate2526 RFA is considered an effectiveand safe treatment for control of BTNsIn most cases the incidence of haemorrhage and other complications is low20However haemorrhage is sometimes lifethreatening because serious haematomasmay compress the upper airways Manyreports have described active bleedingduring FNA of thyroid nodules and RFAof hepatocellular carcinomas14�� andsome reports have described fatalities14ThusimportantcomplicationhaemorrhageanisThree types of haemorrhage may occurperithyroidal subcapsular and intranodular121427� The mechanism of haemorrhage is thoughtto be related to themechanical or thermal injuries induced bythe RFA electrode tip3031 Thyroid nodulesreportedly have abundant capsular vesselsthat are usually anastomosed with vesselspenetrating into the core32 These numerousvessels are abnormal thinwalled and susceptible to rupture Large thyroid nodulesare another cause of haemorrhage becausemultiple insertions are often required totreat such nodules In additionthepatient cannot coordinate with the physician during the RFA procedure the perithyroidal orintrathyroidal vessels mayeasily be damaged by movement of theneedle tip or production of heat

are both essential Patient cooperationis the ﬁrst requirement When the needle tipis in the patient�s body any uncooperativemotion of the patient may lead to injury ofvessels or other structures Most patientscan endure the procedure under local anaesthesia however anxious patients mayrequire general anaesthesia to achieve cooperation If possible smallbore electrodesshould be chosen to decrease the risk ofbleeding35 It is necessary to cauterise thesupplying vasculature of nodules to avoidrecurrence and residue Howeverthepuncture route should be carefully designedto avoid pericapsular vessels and the electrode tip should be closely monitoredActive bleeding during needle puncture isvisible as a rapidly expanding hypoechoicor anechoic signal Locating the haemorrhagic focus is not difﬁcult with CEUSguidance The bleeding pointcan beblocked by RF electrode tip insertion anddirect ablation When the bleeding is toorapid to control with the RF electrode tipby increasing the power drug injection is asuitable alternative Lyophilised thrombin 0cHu et alpowder can be dissolved in normal salineand then injected at the bleeding pointthrough a syringe with US guidance Onereport also described haemorrhage treatedby local injection of hypertonic saline andepinephrine solution in a patient with hepatocarcinoma36 Mildbleeding whichappears as a hypoechoic layer can mostlybe controlled using ice and compression ofthe neck for several minutes after the procedure30 All bleeding can be controlled byconservative methodsthus no surgicalintervention is needed Ecchymosis can befound after the procedure and usually disappears in approximately  to  weeksPostprocedure CEUS is indispensablefor all patients regardless of whether bleeding occurs CEUS is an objective evaluationtool for active bleeding37 Close clinicalobservation for  hours postoperatively isrecommended in our department becausemost bleeding occurs during the ﬁrstlobectomy38Observation of the neck can help to detecta haematoma early and may aid in preventing serious adverse effectsthyroidhoursafterConclusionAcute thyroid bleeding is one possible complication of RFA although rare it is potentially lifethreatening Proper selection ofpatients and sufﬁcient preparation areessential During the RFA procedureboth an effective clinical strategy and adequate technical skills are indispensable Thephysician should trace the electrode tipusing realtime US and sufﬁciently managebleeding Mild bleeding has limited morbidity and can be easily controlled by compression Active bleeding tends to be rarehowever it may be disastrous if the operator is unaware or careless Direct ablationwith the RF electrode tip and drug injectioninto the bleeding focus are effective modalities for active bleeding CEUS and closeobservation are also recommended afterthe procedureto detect abnormalitiesearly RFA is an effective and relativelysafe alternative for selected patients withBTNs if performed by skilled

interesting toexplore whether the prosthesis materialinﬂuencesthepeak effect and the duration of the effectand if so what mechanisms affect the bonemicrostructure and whether there is a wayto change

improving the clinical resultsif the effects of the prosthesis materialitself cannot be blocked18 There is still alack of consensus on standards for prosthesis revision in this context19When assessing the impact of CTA onthe target events we did not observe anincreased incidence of severe orthopaediccomplications other than the complicationsmentioned in this study In one systematicreview the authors presumed that CTA wassuperior to UTA with respect to functionalscores and tolerable orthopaedic complications20 We obtained analogous results interms of hiprelated complications andfunctional scores Multicentre hip arthroplasty data indicate that UTA remains ahighrisk factor for late revision looseningand periprosthetic fractures810 The notabledissimilarities in the results of these variousstudies on hiprelated complications may belargely attributed to the design of the prosthesis prosthesis size and material selection and the surgeon�s experience46affected theThis study has several limitations It hada small sample and its retrospective designis association with some inherent disadvantages We did not stratify the patientsaccording to fracture type or sex In addition the potential comorbidities betweengroups were not well exposed and compared The statistical power used to addressdifferences between the groups was insufﬁcient Differences in the patients� baselinedata may haveresultsFurthermore our analysis did not determine whether the deaths were instigatedby bone cement The risk of hiprelatedcomplications was not analysed The survivalcurve of other prosthesisrelatedcomplications was estimated using theKaplan�Meier method and competitiverisks ie death could have affected thesurvival of the prosthesis Patients whodied lostrevisionHence the revision rate might have beenunderestimated during this long followupwith a fairly high mortality ratethe opportunity forevidenceIn conclusion the ﬁndings described inthe current review uphold an increasingbody ofthat CTA provideshigher functional scores and lower rates ofhiprelated complications than does UTAin elderly patients with osteoporotic displaced FNFs AOOTA 31BC In thiscontext we recommend CTA for the treatment of such FNFs Our ﬁndings may beconducive to alleviating continuing debateregarding which prosthesis UTA or CTAis more suitable for the elderly populationA future

With the development of chemotherapies such as platinums and taxanes survival beyond stage II increased steadilyto  Although chemotherapies improved overall survivalthis is not as dramatic as that in other solid malignancies suchas prostate or breast Furthermore even with the identificationof molecular targets such as BRCA mutations and HER2amplifications clinical success with available therapies hasbeen minimal23 A recent clinical trial with olaparib a polyADP ribose polymerase inhibitor showed little efficacy compared to standard of care4 Although a subset of gastric diseasehas HER2

 Treatmentmore work is needed to elucidate the underlying moleculardrivers and resistance mechanisms in GCGastric cancer is classified mainly using either the Laurenclassification or the World Health anization WHO criteria The Lauren classification compares tumors based ongrowth invasion pattern with  subtypes intestinal well differentiated diffuse poorly differentiated and intermediatemixed67 The majority of patients outside US with GC areyounger 60years old and have the poorly differentiated diffuse subtype which is located within the distal portion of thestomach characterized by poor cellular differentiation and highintratumor heterogeneity This subtype has poorer outcomesdue to its widespread infiltration and invasive nature of thedisease78 Conversely within the United States the pathologyof GC is similar to that of malignancies found within the gastroesophageal junction8 Older patients are primarily impactedand the disease is commonly well differentiated intestinalThe welldifferentiated subtype is found in the cardia or lowerregion of the stomach with welldefined glandular structuresand growth pattern The WHO designation for GC was createdin  and expands vastly on the Lauren classification67There are  subtypes tubular adenocarcinoma papillary adenocarcinoma mucinous adenocarcinoma poorly cohesiveSignet ring cell carcinoma and mixed carcinoma67 Similarities exist between the Lauren and WHO classificationsSignetring cell carcinoma comparable to poorly differentiatedGC is steadily increasing in incidence within the United Statesand around the world9 This increase is attributed to  eradication efforts of Helicobacter pylori a pathogen known toinduce intestinal type GC  increases in genetic predisposition to genes such as Ecadherin CDH1

monoclonal antibodiesand the use of TGFb inhibitors which although promisinghave proven to be highly toxic1920 Additionally these targetshave demonstrated limited clinical utility due to the

exist within the literature as some groups look at the molecular composition of GC asa whole while others focus on differences within the Laurenclassification systemUsing the Oncomine database we have found significantupregulation in several understudied genes in all GCs including COL3A1 COL5A2 SPON2 and CDH11 Table  Wealso have confirmed the upregulated status of many of thegenes found within the literature that are somewhat well knownsuch as INHBA a gene associated with poor overall outcomes24 but are still understudied Claudin  CLDN1 hasbeen found to be highly expressed in GC and is a poor predictive disease marker by mediating tumor necrosis factorainduced cell migration enhancement of proliferation andmetastasis while SULF1 has been found to be significantlyhypomethylated causing significant downregulated proteinexpression2528 This SULF1 downregulation may be indicativeof a posttranslational modification feedback loop or degradation event via protein�protein interactions but is still unclearNot surprisingly a significant underrepresentation was notedwhen comparing publications related to these genes over publications to the commonly studied genes such as MAPKPI3K and TP53 over  total publicationsGenetic Analysis of Upregulated GC Genes Using LaurenType Classified GCsWe stratified the data sets based on the respective Lauren distinguished subtype and have highlighted the vast heterogeneticmolecular landscape within the poorly differentiated diffusewell differentiated intestinal and mixed GC subtypesTable  Poorly differentiated GC shares many similaritieswith GC overall including perturbations in various collagentranscribing genes stimulation of PI3KAKT signaling andperturbations in cellular structural components This is a dominant subtype throughout the world for reasons we have previously mentioned Due to the overabundance of collagentranscribing genes we wanted to explore whether a potentialgenetic link exists Literature search identified a study correlating EhlersDanlos syndrome EDS a disease caused bycollagen gene perturbations to the development of GC29EhlersDanlos syndrome also presents with gastrointestinalinvolvement such as increased rates of heartburn which is arisk factor for developing esophageal cancer3031 Based on thelocation of these gastric tumors within the stomach that is inthe proximal stomach near the esophagus and the connectionbetween gastric and esophageal cancers it is quite possiblethere may be a much stronger correlation between EDS anddiffuse GC than previously thoughtWe have found GC overall does not share many molecularsimilarities with the welldifferentiated subtype of GC withinthe scope of our analysis We have found only a similarityCLDN1 expression Claudin  is a gene involved in coding forthe

distinctly different but we did find similarity with THY1expression both having similar fold changes Although thisgene has not been investigated in GC it is overexpressed inthe pancreatic cancer microenvironment35 Further investigation may be needed as this gene may have importance in GCdevelopmentWe finally investigated the mixed subtype of GC a subtypethat is commonly overlooked within the

protectingtumors from 5flurouracil 5FUinduced death a chemotherapy commonly used to treat GC3738 It is likely the diffusesubtype is not the only subtype with a strong genetic link butthe mixed subtype may have a stronger genetic component thanpreviously thought We hypothesize some of the genetic diversity within GC is masked when analyzed as a whole whichfurther supports the notion of this disease

suggests that this subtype may be more sensitiveto platinum drugs56 This overall downregulation of metabolicpathways may also point to an increase in the Warburg effectThis alternative metabolic

metabolism related genesAlthough this is expected due to its difference in subtypingthe mixed gastric subtype has a much smaller representationwithin the literature than the intestinal and diffuse types and itis clear that further investigation is needed A better understanding of the diverse nature of downregulated genes in allaspects of GC is needed as a first step to identify new therapeutic options that will benefit patients with GCGastric Cancer Exhibits High Molecular DifferencesBetween GendersWithin the United States men and women older than  are athigher risk for developing GC while the male population ishigher in risk for welldifferentiated GC development than thefemale population mainly due to the protective effect of estrogen against developing H pylori induced gastric carcinogenesis62 Females have higher incidence of poorly differentiatedGCs compared to their male counterparts for reasons largelyunknown Various environmental factors play a role in diseasedevelopment as a whole including obesity smoking drinkingand a poor diet6366 A retrospective study by Kim et al hasshown that women not only have a higher incidence of diffusetype GC but have a worse overall prognosis as well as geneticdifferences compared to men including ERb expression67 suggesting a hormonal component may also be a contributing factor to this subset of disease Due to the evident genderdisparities in GC we investigated the underlying moleculardifferences between male and female patients by preformingGEO2R analysis on the GSE118916 data set Our results showstriking differences in differentially expressed genes betweenmales and femalesOverall both male and female patients with GC showed anabundance of upregulated genes Figure 2A After stratifyingbased on gender the female patients with GC have a higherabundance of upregulated genes oncogenic like genes genes greater than 5fold upregulation compared to downregulated genes Figure 2B while male patients with GC have agreater abundance of downregulated genes tumor suppressorlike genes Figure 2B This trend can also be seen from just thetop differentially expressed genes in the provided tables Current treatment options for GC are somewhat limited in achieving a longterm survival benefit and we wanted to use ourcohorts to identify whether there are differences in actionabletargets between gendersFemale Patients With GC Are Vastly UnderrepresentedWithin Clinical StudiesWe found no direct druggable targets according to the DGIdbdatabase with the top differentially expressed genes Therefore we looked further into the individual protein�proteininteraction networks using STRING database Figure 2CFBroadening the scope of our search allowed us to find manypotential druggable targets Table  We narrowed the scopeof our search to inhibitorsantagonist type compounds due tothe substantial genes found to be upregulated Many of thedruggable targets such as estimated glomerular filtration rateEGFR tyrosine

metastatic GC68 Lapatinib aTKI responsible for inhibiting HER2neu and EGFR wastested in a phase III clinical trial TyTAN Trial in Asianpatients with GC69 There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival for Paclitaxel plus Lapatinib overPaclitaxel alone70 We looked further into the patient demographics of the TyTAN trial and noticed a large underrepresentation of female patients within all arms of the study total female patients Another example of this is a trial withBortezomib which interacts with the ADAM17 pathway andhas been tried unsuccessfully in Phase II clinical trials in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic patientswith GC71 As with the Lapatinib trial this one had an overrepresentation of male patients  compared to femalepatients  A common occurrence within many of theGC clinical trials is combination of new therapies with paclitaxel or some type of Taxol We have found the female cohortto have an abundance of druggable targets interact with paclitaxel including EPB41L4B and CAPN9 Table  but largelythis demographic is underrepresented within clinical trial studies It is clear that based on the molecular profile of femalepatients with GC this issue demands further investigationMale Patients With GC May Benefit From HormoneInhibiting TherapiesAs we have previously mentioned the male cohort has anopposite molecular profile compared to the female cohort withWhen screening for actionable drug targets we limited thescope of our analysis to agonists due to the substantial geneticdownregulation already occurring naturally and notion thatmale patients with GC have an abundance of tumor suppressorlike genes In doing so we have found direct druggable targetssuch as SSTR1 and GPT Table  GPT is a gene that encodesthe alanine aminotransaminase  protein and catalyzes thereversible transamination between alanine and 2oxoglutaratewithin the tricarboxylic acid TCA cycle to generate pyruvatea TCA

associated with the development of keloids a number of genes and gene loci have been identified610 Genomewide association studies and admixture mapping studies have identified singlenucleotide polymorphisms across certain loci genetically linked to keloid development including  the  NEDD4  gene  which  encodes  E3 ubiquitin  ligase  enzyme  and  the  myosin  genes MY01E and MYO7A10� Studies have also reported the involvement of several human leucocyte antigen HLA alleles p53 bcl2 and fas genes1014� Furthermore  rare  genetic  disorders  have  been reported  to  present  with  spontaneous  keloids including Dubowitz syndrome Bethlem myopathy RubinsteinTaybi  syndrome  Noonan  syndrome Geominne  syndrome  and  others1017  These  lines of evidence suggest that genetic factors play a role on keloid predispositionPathophysiology of keloidsKeloid  pathology  is  complex  involving  both genetic and environmental factors Keloids form as a result of abnormal wound healing and excessive dermal fibrosis Development of keloids has been linked to overproliferation and reduced apoptosis of dermal fibroblasts overproduction of collagen fibres and other extracellular matrix ECM components as well as abnormal ECM production and remodelling1  Various  cytokines  growth  factors and proteolytic enzymes have been implicated in the  formation  of  keloids  including  transforming growth factor TGF epidermal growth factor EGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF plateletderived growth factor PDGF connective tissue  growth  factor  CTGF  tumour  necrosis factorα  TNFα insulinlike  growth  factor1  IGF1 fibroblast growth factor FGF interleukin6  IL6  and  matrix  metalloproteinases MMPs31418  Furthermore  signalling  pathways such as Tolllike receptor signalling SMAD signalling and fibronectin have been reported to be associated with keloid development1819Histopathology of keloidsHistologically keloids comprise an abundance of unordered  dermal  collagen  and  vasculature  with high  inflammatorycell  infiltrate  and  overactive mesenchymal  cells1415  In  addition  to  collagen elastin  fibronectin  and  proteoglycans  are  deposited in excess amounts in keloid scars9 Collagen creates  frequent  crosslinks  in  ordinary  wounds whereas collagen is irregularly anised in keloids forming nodules in the dermis20 During normal Figure   Earlobe keloids as a consequence of ear piercingarise from skin trauma or inflammation and may develop  years  after  the  initial  insult  and  rarely regress2 The scar tissue extends beyond the original wound site and can be disfiguring and cause psychosocial  issues  impairing  quality  of  life3  In addition  patients  may  present  with  symptoms such as burning pain pruritus movement limitation and hyperaesthesia2AetiologyThe  aetiology  of  keloids  is  still  poorly  understood The most common regions of the skin for keloids include upper arms skin overlying joints chest shoulders and head�neck regions particularly  the  ear  lobes  Figure    The  anatomical location of a keloid appears to alter its morphological characteristics Some keloids can develop spontaneously  however  most  occur  years  after local trauma and other events including inflammation surgery burns elective cosmesis foreign body reactions acne insect bites vaccinations or mechanical force45Epidemiology and keloid geneticsThe incidence of keloids is highest among darkerpigmented  persons  of  African  Asian  and Hispanic  descent  and  is  estimated  to  be  in  the range  of  �  Males  and  females  have  an equal risk of developing keloids6 although incidence  is  slightly  increased  in  females  likely attributable to them having more cosmetic procedures  like  ear  piercing7  Persons  aged  � years  are  also  at  a  higher  risk  of  developing keloids  Additional  risk  factors  include  having blood  type  A  hyperIgE  and  hormonal  peaks during pregnancy or puberty8Familial  keloid  case  studies  and  twin  studies support  the  notion  that  genetic  factors  have  an 0cOjeh  for the treatment of keloids2627 Intralesional TAC injections have been shown to reduce scar volume and height improve scar pliability and diminish associated scar pain and itching8 as well as prevent recurrence3  Corticosteroids  have  antiinflammatory  and  antimitotic  properties1  Several  other mechanisms  have  been  reported  by  which  corticosteroids reduce keloid scar including inhibition of  fibroblast  growth  attenuation  of  procollagen and  glycosaminoglycan  synthesis  reduction  of endothelial  budding  and  enhancement  of  collagen  and  fibroblast  degeneration2829  Corticos teroids  inhibit  TGF1  expression  and  induce apoptosis in fibroblasts inhibit VEGF and alphaglobulins which are involved in the wound healing  process28�  VEGF  which  promotes angiogenesis was reported to be highly expressed in  keloid  fibroblasts  compared  to  controls  but exogenous  addition  of  the  glucocorticoid  dexamethasone  suppressed  its  expression  in  vitro32 Furthermore VEGF expression was overexpressed in  keloid  tissue  which  later  reduced  following intralesional TAC injections in vivo33TAC  is  typically  administered  at  intervals  of �  weeks  until  pruritic  and  painassociated symptoms  diminish  and  the  scar  flattens34  The dose  of  TAC  is  in  the  range  of  �  mgmL depending  on  the  size  and  anatomical  location of the lesion and the age of the patient34 TAC is used either alone as a monotherapy or in combination  with  other  treatment  modalities13  The response  rates  to  corticosteroid  injections  vary clinically  with  regression  rates  in  the  range  of �  reported  after  one  year  and  recurrence  rates  in  the  range  of  �  reported after  five  years3  Combined  therapy  comprising surgical excision followed by TAC treatment also varied  with  reported  recurrence  rates  in  the range  of  �  Previous  clinical  studies where TAC was used alone reported efficacy and good  clinical  outcome  with  this  treatment  including reduced keloid height length width related pruritus and erythema and improved pliability3637  A  recent  randomised  parallelgroup study  that  compared  the  role  of  intralesional TAC  fractional  CO2  laser  or  intralesional  verapamil  in  the  treatment  of  keloid  in    patients showed reduction in scar height vascularity and pliability in all three groups using the Vancouver Scar Scale score however pigmentation was not completely resolved with any of the treatments The  response  was  fastest  with  TAC  followed  by verapamil and laser and this was statistically significant38 However intralesional TAC in combination with other treatment

can be used for the surgical removal of keloids depending on the size of the  keloid  anatomical  location  skin  type  and age of patient52 These include linear closure and flap  coverage  excision  with  grafting  Wplasty and  Zplasty53  To  reduce  risk  of  keloid  recurrence  the  surgeon  performing  the  excision should establish tensionfree wound closure As a general  rule  closure  of  the  wound  should  be accomplished with minimal tension and sutures leaving everted wound borders Zplasties threelayered  sutures  subcutaneousfascial  tensile reduction  sutures  or  local  ﬂap  surgery  can  be employed  on  a  casebycase  basis5455  The  final outcome of the scar is often positively correlated with  the  experience  of  the  operating  surgeon and  technique  utilised  as  well  as  the  patients� active participation in their wound care52Siliconebased productsSince  the  1980s  siliconebased  products  have been used in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic  scars  with  silicone  gel  or  silicone  gel sheeting  considered  as  firstline  therapy  for minor keloids and hypertrophic scars2635 There are  various  other  forms  of  silicone  including creams sprays gel cushion and liquid24 The precise mechanism of action of silicone products is not fully understood but it is proposed that they enhance hydration and create an occlusive environment53 which influences fibroblast regulation and  decreases  collagen  synthesis56  Silicone  gel sheeting  has  been  shown  to  have  minimal  side effects  including  local  irritation  which  can  be resolved  quickly24  Studies  have  shown  that  the beneficial  effects  of  silicone  gel  sheets  include pain reduction tenderness and pruritus and flattening the keloid57 The silicone gel sheeting is recommended to be worn from two weeks after primary  wound  treatment  for  �  h  for  � months58Studies have demonstrated an improvement of up to  in keloid scars after using silicone gel  sheeting35  and  a  decrease  in  the  incidence rates  of  keloids  and  hypertrophic  scars  after  surgery59  In  addition  controlled  studies  have reported the clinical effectiveness of silicone gel and silicone gel sheeting in the prevention and treatment of keloids3558 However a recent metaanalysis  review60  and  Cochrane  review61  found that even though studies published data in support of the efficacy of silicone gel sheeting in the treatment  and  prevention  of  keloid  and  hypertrophic  scarring  they  provided  weak  evidence and  were  of  poor  quality60�  Therefore  given Figure   Auricular keloid surgical excision used as monotherapy Auricular keloid before a and after b surgical excisonsurgery all yielded significant improvements compared to treatment with TAC monotherapy339�Intralesional  steroid  injections  can  cause  several  adverse  side  effects  such  as  telangiectasis atrophy steroid acne pigmentary changes necrosis ulcerations and systemic side effects3 There is also  significant  pain  associated  with  intradermal corticosteroid injections that can be reduced when local anaesthetic lidocaine is administered to control the pain44 Furthermore the side effects have been reported to diminish when intralesional TAC is used in combination with 5FU45Surgical excisionSurgical excision is a traditional method of removing keloids Figure  However excision creates a new wound and can result in a similar or larger keloid47  Therefore  surgical  excision  is  not  recommended as a monotherapy as it results in high recurrence  rates  in  the  range  of  � For better postoperative surgical outcomes surgical excision is often combined with other forms of treatment  including  radiotherapy  intralesional corticosteroid  injections  IFN  injection  bleomycin cryotherapy pressure therapy and silicone gel or sheeting82649 Successful use of dermal substitutes and epidermal skin grafting with keloid excision has also been reported50 A recent case series study  in  which    patients  with  anterior  chest wall keloids were given a treatment protocol consisting  of  complete  excision  Zplasty  postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and postsurgical wound selfmanagement  reported  excellent  outcomes with a recurrence rate of only  The use of steroid tape and injections helped to resolve the recurrence of keloids51 0cOjeh  the  lack  of  substantial  evidence  welldesigned clinical trials and studies are required to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of siliconebased products in preventing and treating keloidsPressure therapyPressure therapy has been used to treat and manage keloids and hypertrophic scars for decades3563 It has been routinely employed as firstline treatment  in  the  treatment  of  hypertrophic  scarring resulting  from  burns64  The  underlying  mechanisms of action of compression techniques remain unclear however several hypotheses exist some of which include increased pressure to the scar surface  reduces  perfusion  and  decreased  oxygen  to the location of injury reduces collagen synthesis It is  also  thought  that  pressure  increases  apoptosis reduces  scar  hydration  stabilising  mast  cells  and decreases angiogenesis165 The application of pressure can be achieved using a variety of materials such as adhesive plaster moulds pressure earrings and  customfitted  splints16  which  have  improved scar cosmesis and rates of keloid recurrence66� A continuous  pressure  of  �  mmHg  preferably at the lower range soon after wound reepithelialisation for � h per day for   months is recommended166869 The efficacy of pressure therapy depends mainly on the anatomical location of the scar with trunk and limb areas being more appropriate  sites  for  pressure  therapy  In  addition  a pressure garment is predominantly used for auricular  keloids  where  pressure  clips  are  commonly utilised  after  surgery6670  As  an  adjuvant  therapy this form of pressure garment has also been successfully  used  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of keloids6667 In contrast a metaanalysis review that analysed  the  effectiveness  of  pressure  garment therapy  for  the  prevention  of  abnormal  scarring after  burn  injury  was  unable  to  demonstrate  any beneficial effects of pressure garment therapy on prevention  or  treatment  of  abnormal  scarring59 Notwithstanding success rates of pressure therapy are contingent upon patient compliance69 which can sometimes be low due to discomfort Overall pressure therapy is tolerated better and is devoid of the pain often associated with intralesional therapies and hence can be considered as a good adjuvant therapy for keloid scarsRadiotherapyIn  the treatment of keloids using superficial Xray irradiation was first described71 Since then it has been used less frequently as a monotherapy and more widely as an effective adjunct treatment after surgical excision72� with success rates in the range  of  �  and  recurrence  rates  of about  Radioactive skin patches have also been used in combination with other treatment modalities  for  keloids7879  Radiotherapy  is  most commonly used � h after surgical excision7480 and acts by suppressing angiogenesis and inhibiting ﬁbroblast activity1 Decreased fibroblast proliferation  induced  cell  senescence  and  apoptosis leading to reduction in collagen production and suppression  of  keloid  development  have  also been reported81�Different  radiotherapy  modalities  have been  used  after  surgical  excision  including electron  beam  radiotherapy  brachytherapy superﬁcial and orthovoltage radiotherapy with varying  degrees  of  success84  Mankowski  et a0 al conducted  a  literature  review  of    studies  to compare  the  clinical  outcome  of  different forms of radiation treatment used for the management of keloids77 The metaanalysis demonstrated  that  radiation  used  as  monotherapy yielded higher rates of recurrence  compared  to  combinational  therapy  with  postsurgery excision  Comparison between the different  radiationbased  treatments  revealed that the lowest rate of recurrence was observed with  brachytherapy    followed  jointly  by Xray    and  electron  beam    The authors  also  reported  that  the  rate  of  recurrence was dependent on anatomical site of the keloid  with  chest  keloids  having  the  highest recurrence rate73The  adverse  effects  of  radiotherapy  often linked  with  dose  of  radiation  used  can  be grouped into acute skin reactions and late complications Acute reactions arise as early as seven days after keloid treatment and include oedema necrosis  ulceration  desquamation  erythema and  pigmentary  changes  with  the  latter  two being  the  most  common  Late  complications which include changes in pigment atrophy telangiectasis  and  alopecia  may  present  several weeks after radiotherapy Emollient and steroid ointment used after radiotherapy can help alleviate the side effects19 A recommended radiation dose   Gy over several sessions can also minimise  adverse  effects1980  Radiotherapy  carries  a risk of malignancy8586 Therefore caution should be used in radiationvulnerable sites such as the head  neck  thyroid  and  breast  and  in  patients aged   years2 Protecting fragile ans and selecting  the  most  appropriate  sitedependent dose protocol can help minimise further complications of radiotherapy87 0c Scars Burns  HealingCryotherapyCryotherapy is a lowtemperature treatment that causes  vascular  damage  resulting in  tissue  necrosis88 It has been used to treat keloids as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment  methods  such  as  intralesional  steroid  injections89  Various  delivery  methods  used  for cryotherapy include spray and contact probes or the intralesionalneedle  cryoprobe  method Compared to contact and spray methods intralesionalneedle  cryoprobe  was  found  to  be  the most effective method in treating keloid scars90 Positive outcomes were observed in a number of studies  that  used  liquid  nitrogen  and  cryotherapy to treat keloids with success rates in the range of ��External  cryotherapy  has  been  associated with several side effects including hypopigmentation  blistering  pain  delayed  healing  and  infection9093 Moreover larger keloids have been shown to need multiple cryotherapy sessions9093 To  minimise  side  effects  intralesional  cryotherapy was introduced and there are now a number of  nitrogenbased  cryodevices  that  have  been described for the treatment of keloid scars with two  commercially  available  a  liquid  nitrogenbased device88 and an argon gasbased device94 The  intralesional  cryotherapy  was  designed  to overcome the hypopigmentation seen mostly in darkskinned individuals with external cryotherapy It works by destroying the core of the keloid sparing the surface epithelial cells including melanocytes9596  As  a  result  it  enhances  volume decrease  while  minimising  the  risk  of  hypopigmentation and other surface reactions90 A recent comprehensive  review  based  on  the  preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalysis was performed to investigate the efficacy of  intralesional  cryotherapy  on  keloid  scars90 The review of eight studies that met the inclusion criteria  revealed  that  average  scar  volume decreased  in  the  range  of  �  but  complete eradication of the scar on average was lacking Recurrence of keloid scars was in the range of  �  The  authors  also  reported  that patients�  complaints  of  pain  and  pruritus  was considerably  reduced  however  hypopigmentation was seen mostly in Fitzpatrick � skin type patients after treatment90Laser therapyLaser  therapy  for  keloid  treatment  was  introduced in the 1980s97 Since then different systems have been used for the treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars4898 These lasers target skin chromophores like haemoglobin and melanin based on the principle of selective photothermolysis99  Lasers  can  be  classified  as ablative  and  nonablative  The  most  common ablative  lasers  include  the  2940nm  erbiumdoped  yttrium  aluminium  garnet  ErYAG laser and the 10600nm carbon dioxide CO2 laser These emit a laser beam that is absorbed by  water  in  the  skin  leading  to  local  tissue destruction  and  reduction  of  lesion  volume3 Common  examples  of  nonablative lasers include 585nm or 595nm PDLs 1064nm neodymiumdopedyttriumaluminiumgarnet NdYAG neodymiumdopedvanadate  NdVan  laser  and    nm Qswitched  NdYAG  laser  with  low  fluence100 These lasers induce thermal injury to the scar�s microvasculature  leading  to  thrombosis  and ischaemia  which  result  in  collagen  denaturation and collagen fibre realignment101�532nm laser Laser  therapy  requires  several  treatments  at intervals of � weeks depending on scar type and type  of  laser  used98104  with  possible  side  effects including itching pigmentary changes blister formation  and  postoperative  purpura98  The  use  of the  nonfractional  vascular  �  nm  PDL  in the  treatment  of  keloid  and  hypertrophic  scars has been welldocumented105� and has response rates in the range of � PDL monotherapy has been shown to be effective108110 as well as CO2 laser monotherapy38111112 In a clinical study where  patients with moderate to severe keloids were  treated  with  highenergy  pulsed  CO2  laser the  treatment  was  efficacious  and  welltolerated with minimal side effects112 In other studies where CO2 laser ablation was compared with other forms of treatment CO2 laser was as efficient as the other forms38111 It must be noted however that these studies are small and randomised controlled studies are lacking98Laser therapy such as PDL CO2 and NdYAG have  been  associated  with  a  high  rate  of  recurrence at � months111113� However optimal results  can  be  achieved  with  combination  treatment  especially  with  intralesional  TAC  injections116�  Kumar  and  coworkers  conducted  a cohort  study  on    patients  with  keloids  previously treated with an NdYAG laser and reported complete scar resolution and flattening in seven patients  only  when  intralesional  TAC  was  used after  laser  therapy41  Moreover  combined  therapy  with  PDL  and  TAC119  and  PDL  TAC  and 5FU36  were  shown  to  produce  better  clinical results In a recent study that evaluated and compared  the  efficacy  of  combination  therapy  of 0cOjeh  scars statistically fractional CO2 laser and intralesional TAC injection or TAC injection alone in keloid and hypertrophic significant improvements were reported in overall scar quality  with  the  combined  treatment  options  comto  TAC  monotherapy120  Moreover pared combined  CO2  laser  and  IFNα2b  injections given to patients with auricular keloids resulted in no recurrence in  of patients three years after treatment121 Laser therapy can also be combined  with  other  laser  treatment  topical  corticosteroids  and  cyanoacrylate  glue98  and  have shown  promising  results  however  larger  controlled clinical studies are needed to further evaluate their efficacy and safetyRecently  lasers  are  also  being  explored  as tools for assisted drug delivery Kraeva et a0al proposed an alternative technique of corticosteroid administration  of  laserassisted  drug  delivery  of topical TAC This was shown to be effective when used  on  a  keloid  on  the  posterior  scalp  of  a patient after each CO2 laser session122 More efficient  intraepidermal  drug  delivery  options  are also being investigated Singhal et a0al developed TACcontaining  polymeric  microps  that were prepared using a cryomilling technique for freezing fracture After ablation with a fractional ErYAG laser these microps can be deposited in cutaneous micropores and provide highdose intraepidermal  reservoir  systems  with minimal transdermal permeation leading to sustained and targeted local drug delivery123It must be noted that one of the biggest limitations in studies available at present is the lack of  histological  definition  between  keloid  and hypertrophic scars so conclusions are not  valid on efficacyImiquimod  creamImiquimod  cream is approved for the treatment  of  basal  cell  carcinoma  actinic  keratoses and genital warts21 As an immuneresponse modifier it stimulates the production of proinflammatory  cytokines  such  as  TNFα  interleukins

and diagnostic prognostic and treatment approaches for patientsCurrent  diagnostic  approaches  predominantly  involve established virological procedures such as nucleic acid hybridization techniques reversetranscriptase PCR [RTPCR] and recombinase  polymerase  amplification  RPA  as  well  as immunologic  approaches like  antibody  assays  Each approach  boasts  unique  strengths  and  weaknesses  For instance while RTPCR demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity  its  capabilities  have  been  severely  limited  for practical reasons during this current pandemic due to global shortages of skilled personnel reagents and equipment and a processing time of up to  days By contrast immunologic tests such as antibody assays are rapid and require minimal equipment  but  they  have  limited  utility  in  the  context  of acute diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infections This is because it can take several days to weeks following symptom onset for a patient to mount a detectable antibody response6Immunological tools in research include enzymelinked immunosorbent  assays  ELISAs  flow  cytometry  and mass cytometry CyTOF Imaging techniques for pathological analyses include conventional approaches such as hematoxylin�eosin HE staining immunohistochemical IHC  staining  or  transmission  electron  microscopy TEM and RNAscope Each of these methods is used to examine the pathophysiology underlying COVID19 from a different perspective each with their own advantages and disadvantages  For  example  it  has  been  established  that the entry of SARSCoV2 intro cells depends on the binding of viral proteins with the human receptor angiotensinconverting  enzyme    ACE2  receptors7  Additionally evidence  shows  that  the  type  II  transmembrane  protease TMPRSS2 is also essential for viral entry by priming the viral spike protein for binding to ACE28 Therefore considerable  research  efforts  employing  different  techniques have  been  directed  at  mapping  the  distribution  of ACE2 and  TMPRSS2  in  tissues  and  their  relationship  to  the observed manifestations of disease Together the combination of these approaches has advanced our understanding of COVID19In  this  review  we  discuss  the  current  approaches  in COVID19 diagnosis and research with a focus on findings from  virological  and  pathological  imaging  methods  We also  discuss  immunological  methods  which  are  increasingly  recognized  as  an  integral  component  of  the  disease processDiagnosticsThe most common symptoms of COVID19 at initial presentation  are  nonspecific  and  include  a  high  fever  a  new and  persistent  cough  and  fatigue910  Due  to  similarities between the clinical characteristics of COVID19 and many other respiratory illnesses the accurate and early detection of infection is pivotal for outbreak control Any delays in diagnosis are increasingly measured in lives lostAccording to the World Health anization WHO the immediate goal for research into COVID19 diagnostics is the  development  of  RNA  assays  antibody  and  antigen assays  and  pointofcare  detection11  The  intermediateterm priority would be their integration into multiplex diagnostic  platforms  while  the  longterm  goal  would  be  the investigation of prognostic markersIn this section we summarize the current and emerging diagnostic  tools  for  SARSCoV2  through  the  lens  of immunologyLabBased TestsRTPCR  Molecular  Testing  The  detection  of  viral  nucleic acids by RTPCR is the primary method used to confirm a suspected  case  of  COVID19  RTPCR  and  other  nucleic acid hybridization techniques are an integral part of virology and are applied in a broad range of settings including screening  diagnosis  informing  medical  and  therapeutic decisions and assessing cure rates from therapy12 Chinese officials released the genomic sequence of SARSCoV2 to public databases early in the course of the outbreak13 and the WHO has since published seven protocols for RTPCRbased diagnostics Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of RTPCR it is regarded as the �gold standard� for virus detection14 There are two essential steps in the process  viral RNA extraction and  PCR amplification and  probebased  detection  Multiple  largescale  highthroughput  instruments  are  available  for  automating  both steps such as the Roche Cobas  system which has an advertised throughput of  tests per  hours15However RTPCRbased testing is costly and timeconsuming requiring up to  days using centralized laboratory equipment and skilled personnel furthermore global supply  chain  challenges  have  led  to  significant  shortages  of essential reagents Lastly falsenegative results due to low sample  volumes  variable  sampling  techniques  and  sampling  locations  sample  degradation  during  transportation andor improper nucleic acid extraction are a concern16� In  addition  the  differences  in  detectable  viral  material  in different sampling locations eg nasopharyngeal vs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF] vs rectal samples might also  explain  the  falsepositive  RTPCR  results  on  repeat testing  in  �recovered�  COVID19  patients  Indeed  one postmortem case study revealed residual virus in lung tissue despite  consecutive  negative  results  on  PCR  testing  from nasopharyngeal  swabs19  Separately  Winichakoon  et  al outlined a case of repeatedly negative nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal  swabs  in  a  clinically  deteriorating  patient where only a BALF PCR test returned positive20Given the high expression of ACE2 on alveolar epithelial cells and negative expression on nasal oral and nasopharynx  0cTan et al cells21  it  would  be  prudent  to  perform  bronchoalveolar lavage  on  patients  to  rule  out  falsenegative  results  from swabs of upper respiratory tract samples20LabBased  Immunological  Assays  In  contrast  to  RTPCR techniques  that  detect  viral  nucleic  acids  serological  and immunological  assays  aim  to  detect  antibodies  against SARSCoV2 or antigenic proteins in infected individuals Neutralization assays are considered the gold standard for assessing  neutralizing  protective  antibodies22  however these  assays  require  specialized  biosafety  level    BSL3 facilities  and  still  take  several  days  to  complete Another type of labbased antibody assay is the traditional ELISA which  detects  all  binding  antibodies  The  four  principal types of ELISA are direct indirect competitive and sandwich  ELISA  the  indirect  ELISA  is  the  most  common method  for  determining  antibody  concentrations  ELISAs have  good  concordance  with  neutralization  assays  for  the detection of antibody responses in SARSCoV223 Unfortunately  both  methods  require  skilled  operators  and  are limited by low throughput due to the absence of fully automated systemsSerological  diagnostics  offer  several  advantages  Re quirements  for  specimen  quality  are  comparatively  less stringent  than  for  nucleic  acid  tests  as  the  antibodies  are uniformly  distributed  in  the  serum24  Consequently  sampling  location  concerns  do  not  apply  here  Furthermore good correlation between IgG ELISAs performed on both conventional serum samples and plasma samples have been reported25 of which the latter may be conveniently obtained from residual blood submitted for other routine laboratory testsOne pitfall of antibody assays is their limited utility early in the course of any infection Sparse data are available with regard to the antibody responses produced by patients with COVID19 It seems that SARSCoV2 IgM is detectable at a  median  of    days  after  symptom  onset  while  IgG  is detectable  after    days26  with  the  seroconversion  rate approaching    by  day    An  Italian  research  group noted  that  the  performance  of  a  commercial  VivaDiag COVID19 IgMIgG test was very poor with a sensitivity of only  and a negative predictive value of  in a cohort of suspected COVID19 patients in the emergency room setting27 As such we believe that for now RTPCR testing  is  likely  more  appropriate  for  diagnosing  acute COVID19Notably  a  longitudinal  study  examining  the  IgGIgM profiles  of    patients  found  that  seroconversion  for  IgG and IgM occurred in no specific chronological order with a median  of    days  after  symptom  onset28  all  patients achieved  seroconversion  by  day    Consequently  the detection of both IgG and IgM simultaneously rather than one antibody alone would be idealAnother  concern  surrounding  serologic  diagnostics  is the production of falsepositive results from crossreactivity due to the high prevalence of the four endemic human coronaviruses  in  the  human  population  In  SARSCoV2 the spike S protein which includes two regions S1 and S2  and  the  nucleocapsid  N  protein  NP  are  the  major immunogens29 and therefore most diagnostics rely on the detection  of  antibodies  specific  for  these  antigens  One work  suggests  that  of  the  possible  targets  the  S1  subunit antigen is more specific than either the whole S antigen or the N antigen for detecting SARSCoV2 antibodies with no crossreactivity to other coronaviruses except for SARSCoV23  Given  that  only    SARSCoV  infections  were recorded worldwide30 the risk of false positives from this crossreactivity  is  miniscule  However  NP  ELISAs  are more sensitive than S1 in detecting antibodies in those with a mild infection23 Importantly as in SARSCoV most of the neutralizing antibodies are directed against the S protein31  of  which  S1  contains  a  receptorbinding  domain RBD responsible for making contact with ACE2 to facilitate  viral  entry7  Thus  theoretically  only  diagnostics  that detect S1specific antibodies are suitable to infer immunity to  COVID19  this  fact  is  corroborated  by  evidence  that antiS RBD but not antiNP IgG levels correlated with neutralizing antibody titers in sera from a cohort of  recovered patients32 The number of commercial antibody assays is  growing  detecting  either  antiNP  antibodies  antiS1S antibodies  or  both  there  is  also  large  variation  in  their claimed sensitivities and specificities33 Based on the available evidence an ideal serological assay would be a combined test that simultaneously detects both antibodies to NP and S1 antigens assessment of antiNP antibodies has good sensitivity and would be best suited for supporting the diagnosis  of  infection  while  the  additional  antiS1  antibody assay would allow for the determination of immunityRapid TestsPointofCare RTPCR Tests  A small number of commercial pointofcare tests utilizing RTPCR have been developed These typically involve the same methodology as conventional RTPCR but implemented with automated and portable  benchtopsized  instruments  that  can  be  operated closer  to  patient  care  settings  than  a  centralized  laboratory  A  prominent  example  is  Cepheid�s  Xpert  Xpress SARSCoV2 run on the Gene Xpert platform This apparatus can provide a result within  min Others include the MesaBioTech Accula Test and MicrosensDx RapiPrep COVID19 Despite displaying good sensitivity and specificity  these  instruments  are  generally  limited  by  a  very low  throughput  of  only  one  to  four  tests  per  run  per machine34 and as such are only suited to small laboratories or clinics 0c SLAS Technology  Figure   Loopmediated isothermal amplification

 labbased  antibody assays rapid assays such as lateral flow immunoassays LFIAs Fig  and chemiluminescent immunoassays CLIAs Fig  offer the benefits of rapid diagnostic testing at a low cost These assays do not require specialized equipment or expertise35 and are thus excellent candidates for  pointofcare  testing  or  deployment  on  a  large  scale This an area of intense interest with governments worldwide  aiming  to  order  millions  of  tests  to  inform  policy makers about attack rates in their populations36 LFIAs are predominantly  singleuse  kits  designed  for  pointofcare use while CLIAs are fully automated analyzers that permit very high testing throughputUnfortunately  these  tests  do  not  quantify  the  antibody titers  and  the  performance  of  LFIAs  has  been  called  into question one evaluation of nine commercial LFIAs reported a sensitivity ranging from only  to  versus RTPCR and    to    versus  ELISA37  Meanwhile  the  performance of CLIAs is superior with good sensitivity and specificity levels similar to those of ELISA38 Otherwise these tests  share  the  same  advantages  and  drawbacks  as  the  0cTan et al Table   Summary of Diagnostic

these different methodologies are outlined in Table Antigen Assays  An alternative approach to immunological assays is to directly detect SARSCoV2 viral antigens Several  commercial  pointofcare  antigen  tests  are  available but their performance remains to be evaluated These tests may be suitable for making an early diagnosis and are deployable as pointofcare assays However they face the same  sampling  limitations  as  RTPCR  and  are  hypothetically hampered by limited sensitivity due to the omission of  an  amplification  process  unlike  nucleic  acid  testing For  example  one  multicenter  study  evaluating  the  Corisbio COVID19 Ag RespiStrip a lateral flow assay for the SARSCoV2 NP reported a test sensitivity of only Rapid  NonPCR  Molecular  Testing  Nucleic  acid  testing using nonPCR methods is an emerging approach for rapid diagnostics  and  several  assays  have  received  Food  and Drug Administration FDA emergency use authorization which  facilitates  the  distribution  of  unapproved  medical products or the offlabel use of approved medical products  when  certain  criteria  are  met  These  methods  share high sensitivity and specificity on par with RTPCR but with  the  principal  advantages  of  more  rapid  testing  at  a lower cost40�LAMP Fig  is one such novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that does not require a thermal cycler One example is the ID NOW COVID19 test from Abbott Diagnostics which can deliver results in just  min43 and uses  a  lightweight  portable  instrument  allowing  onsite testing of swab samples However it has a limited throughput of only one sample per runThe CRISPR enzymes Cas12 and Cas13 have also been adapted  for  rapid  nucleic  acid  sensing    Fig    The DETECTR  assay  by  Mammoth  Biosciences45  as  well  as the  SHERLOCK  assay  by  Sherlock  Biosciences46  potentially offers sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of RTPCR but can be completed in  h However these approaches are still in the early stages of commercialization and current applications are available only as test kits to be run in labs while pointofcare versions exist as proofofconcept

antibodies are captured by immobilized antibodies in the control lineSerum Prognostic Markers  Another application of immunological methods would be to measure markers that enable prognostication  in  COVID19  Higher  titers  of  antibodies against  SARSCoV2  have  been  associated  with  more severe  disease2350  similar  to  previous  studies  in  Middle East  respiratory  syndrome  MERS�CoV51  ELISA  has been used to provide a quantitative measurement of serum and  plasma  IgM  and  IgG  antibodies  By  monitoring  the kinetics of IgM and IgG antibodies specific to the N and S proteins on SARSCoV2 it was found that intensive care unit ICU patients had a significantly lower level of SIgG within    weeks  of  symptom  onset  but  a  higher  level  of NIgG antibodies compared with nonICU patients52 This finding highlights the possible utility of SIgG and NIgG as a prognostic tool for COVID19 patientsThe Ddimer level which consists of crosslinked fibrin degradation products that reflect ongoing blood clot formation  and  breakdown  activity  in  the  body  is  another  proposed  prognostic  marker  Modern  commercial  assays  for Ddimers are based on monoclonal antibodies employing either ELISA or microlatex agglutination assays53 Reports have emerged that elevated Ddimer levels suggestive of a hypercoagulable state are associated with drastically worse outcomes A Chinese group reported that Ddimer levels of ��  �gmL  on  admission  were  associated  with  a   times  increased  mortality  relative  to  Ddimer  levels  of   �gmL in a cohort of  COVID19 patients54 This finding of Ddimer levels as a negative prognostic marker was also noted in other studies conducted in China455 and the Netherlands56Similarly  interleukin  IL6  a  key  component  of  the cytokine release syndrome is another marker measured by ELISA  and  has  been  described  to  independently  predict adverse outcomes in COVID195758 Tumor necrosis factor alpha  TNFα  another  important  proinflammatory  cytokine  has  also  been  found  to  be  strongly  correlated  with Figure   Chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay CLIA SARSCoV2 antigens will capture IgM and IgG

 S  proteinbindingresistant ACE2 mutants48 out of  identified protein altering variants Separately Stawiski et al analyzed ACE2 polymorphisms  within  a  much  larger  population  dataset  spanning more than  population groups across the world and performed structural predictions to identify variants that might confer protection or rather increase susceptibility to SARSCoV2 S protein binding49 Out of a total of  identified proteinaltering ACE2 variants  variants were predicted to increase susceptibility while  variants were speculated to  confer  protection  however  the  degree  of  changes  in receptor�virus binding interactions for each structural variant was not quantified These findings represent significant developments in our understanding of population risk profiles for COVID19 and future coronavirus infections 0cTan et al endan  damage  and  mortality  even  after  adjusting  for disease severity scores59 Gao et al examined both IL6 and Ddimer levels they proposed a panel comprising tandem testing of these two markers which produced a sensitivity of    and  specificity  of    in  early  prediction  of severe COVID1958 Elevated troponin levels a marker of myocardial  injury  measured  with  ELISA  immunoassays also strongly predict progression to death in patients with severe illness60 These results suggest that multiplex cytokine and serum marker profiling will be a powerful tool in stratifying  patients  that  may  guide  clinical  decisions  and resource allocationSummary  In sum rapid progress has been made in diagnostics for COVID19 Yet the race against time continues for researchers and biotechnology firms to develop rapid costeffective  and  reliable  test  kits  that  can  be  deployed on a large scale At the time of writing labbased RTPCR testing  has  been  the  dominant  diagnostic  approach  but alternative molecular approaches like isothermal amplification and CRISPR which have clear advantages are on the horizon Immunological tests such as CLIA and LFIA will become increasingly important because of the urgent need for  pointofcare  diagnostics  for  mass  testing  of  infected asymptomatic individuals and their close contacts and will be  valuable  in  complementing  molecular  approaches  for confirming  infection  Furthermore  immunological  assays will  be  in  great  demand  by  policy  makers  worldwide  for the  assessment  of  immunity  to  COVID19  However  the performance of these serological tests varies significantly particularly  their  degree  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  we believe that caution must be taken in the interpretation of these tests Detailed evaluation of the reliability of serological tests will be a key area for future research Lastly given the  importance  of  techniques  like  ELISA  in  prognosticating COVID19 immunological methods will undoubtedly occupy a crucial role in achieving all levels of the WHO�s short medium and longterm diagnostic goalsCOVID19 Research ToolsImmunological ApproachesCOVID19  infection  has  a  poor  prognosis  in  individuals with  comorbidities  and  abnormal  immune  functions Although  research  surrounding  COVID19  is  still  in  its infancy several studies have revealed lymphopenia and the cytokine  storm  as  underlying  mechanisms  correlating  to disease progression Here we discuss the various immunological techniques involved in assessing host immunity in COVID19 patientsELISA  As  discussed  ELISA  has  also  been  used  to  detect the  inflammatory  cytokines  implicated  in  the  cytokine storm seen in patients with severe respiratory failure due to COVID19  One  study  found  that  the  immune  dysregulation in patients with severe respiratory failure was due to a significantly  increased  production  of  IL6  and  defective lymphoid function because of an IL6mediated decrease in HLADR  expression  on  CD14  monocytes  Interestingly interferongamma  IFNγ  levels  were  below  the  detection level in these patients suggesting that T helper Th  cells are  unlikely  to  be  major  players  in  the  overinflammatory response  of  severe  patients61  A  similar  observation  was made in a separate study whereby inflammatory cytokines that mediate major immune responses such as TNFα and IL1β  were  not  significantly  elevated  in  ICU  patients62 These findings demonstrate that the immunophenotype of patients with COVID19 can vary depending on presently unclear host immune factors and the severity of their condition This  relationship  between  disease  severity  and  cytokine storm has also been highlighted in other studies that found  a  significantly  elevated  plasma  concentration  of granulocyte  colonystimulating  factor  GCSF  IP10 CCL2 and CCL3 in ICU patients compared with nonICU patients63ELISA is also being used as a companion diagnostic tool for therapeutic purposes In a study that explored the use of convalescent plasma therapy from donors as a form of treatment in severe COVID19 ELISA was used to assess the neutralizing activity of the RBDspecific IgM and IgG antibodies found in the donor convalescent plasma64 After the transfusion was complete ELISA was also used to detect IgG  IgM  and  neutralizing  antibody  titers  in  the  sera  of patients to assess the response to treatment65EnzymeLinked Immunosorbent Spot  Enzymelinked immunosorbent spot ELISPOT is a sensitive immunoassay that quantitatively measures cytokinesecreting cells at the singlecell level providing insight into immunerelated cellular activities66 Hence it is a promising tool for characterizing specific Tcell  immunity  in  COVID19  patients  By  IFNγ ELISPOT  analysis  it  was  revealed  that  convalescent COVID19  patients  had  significantly  increased  levels  of IFNγsecreting T cells when compared with healthy donors A  significant  correlation  between  neutralizing  antibody titers and NPspecific T cells was identified in these patients suggesting  that  a  combination  of  humoral  and  cellular immunity  is  integral  to  clearing  SARSCoV2  Interestingly  it  was  noted  that  in  convalescent  patients    weeks IFNγsecreting  Tcell  numbers  had postdischarge decreased suggesting that they may not be maintained for a prolonged period of time even in recovered patients67ELISPOT is also serving a vital role in vaccine development through the detection of potential Tcell epitopes in  the  S  protein  RBD  of  SARSCoV268  One  study  was able  to  harness  ELISPOT  assays  to  identify  three  Tcell epitopes that induced a strong adaptive immune response  0c SLAS Technology  postimmunization demonstrating the promise of ELISPOT assays  in  the  area  of  vaccine  development32  Recently ELISPOT has also been applied to assess the immunogenicity of newly developed vaccines One such study successfully  utilized  an  IFNγ  ELISPOT  assay  to  evaluate Tcell responses to a new SARSCoV2 vaccine in murine splenocytes and rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs The promising findings from this animal study informed the start of a phase I clinical trial with  the  same  vaccine  highlighting  the  usefulness  of ELISPOT in assessing immune responses to new vaccines and promoting vaccine development69Flow Cytometry  Unlike ELISA and ELISPOT flow cytometry determines the number of cytokinesecreting cells and has the capacity to immunophenotype based on surface and intracellular markers70 In relation to the current pandemic this technique enables the detection sorting and analysis of multiple subpopulations of immune cells specific to COVID Using flow cytometry researchers detected a cytotoxic immune  environment  in  patient  blood  samples  despite  a reduction in the overall lymphocyte population71� As part of the SARSCoV2 antiviral response peripheral lymphocytes  retain  the  capacity  to  activate  and  differentiate  into subpopulations  such  as  antibodysecreting  cells  CD3�CD19CD27hiCD38hi follicular T cells CD4CXCR5ICOSPD1  CD4 Th  cells  CD38HLADRCD4  cytotoxic T Tc cells CD38HLADRCD8 and regulatory T  Treg  cells  CD3CD4CD25CD127�  These  Tc cells harbor large amounts of cytotoxic granules while CD4 Th  cells  skewed  toward  a  proinflammatory Th1  and  Th17 phenotype727375 The overall hyperinflammation and cytotoxic environment supports the notion that a cytokine storm could be liable for the multisystemic insults in patients with severe COVID19Elicitation of antiviral Tcell responses specific to SARSCoV2 is of utmost importance to establishing viral control Many studies have demonstrated robust antiviral responses however there is no known set of markers reported to identify  SARSCoV2specific  T  cells

uncommon for patients with HCC to have multiple comorbidities [] Liver cirrhosis with compromised liver function and decreased hepatic reserve is a major risk factor for HCC development Other HCCrelated comorbidities include hepatitis B virushepatitis C virus infection alcoholic liver disease NASH and diabetes [] In addition metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperlipidemia and hypertension is linked to development of NAFLD which may progress to NASH cirrhosis and finally HCC [] For patients with HCC assessment of liver function is a key step in treatment decisionmaking [] Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are predominantly excluded from clinical trials in HCC therefore treatment of these patients is complicated by a lack of prospective clinical data as well as competing comorbidities []Although the number of patients with HCC and prior an transplant is limited these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and treatment is complicated by the need for immunosuppression TKIs may be used to treat posttransplant HCC recurrence although supporting data are limited The use of TKIs in these patients is complex so treatment decisions

associated with an increased risk of fatal bleeding [ ] Immunotherapies are associated with an increased risk of an rejection in posttransplant patients []   Cabozantinib Clearance and a0ExposureTKIs are associated with high interpatient variability in clearance and exposure which may affect both efficacy and tolerability This variability may be due to a variety of factors including genetic background drug�drug interactions drugfood interactions and renal or hepatic impairment [] As evidenced by exposureresponse modeling patients with low clearance of cabozantinib may have higher exposure and an increased risk of developing certain AEs [ ] Awareness of these nuances may help clinicians to mitigate their effects thereby balancing efficacy with tolerability   Hepatic and a0Renal ImpairmentAccording to pharmacokinetic analyses of patients with HCC and other tumor types mild hepatic impairment is predicted to have a minimal effect on cabozantinib exposure [] therefore adjustment of the recommended 60mg starting dose is not necessary for patients with Child�Pugh A 0cliver function [ ] Data on the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib in patients with moderate ChildPugh B or severe Child�Pugh C hepatic impairment are limited [] As per the US Food and Drug Administration FDA prescribing information the starting dose of cabozantinib should be reduced to  mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment while cabozantinib is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [] Note that the European Summary of Product Characteristics SmPC does not recommend dose adjustments for moderate hepatic impairment owing to limited data [] For patients with HCC increased exposure due to hepatic impairment should be considered if intolerable AEs develop and dose modification undertaken as recommended Fig a0 [ ] Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment owing to the potential for increased exposure although no dose adjustments are necessary Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment owing to lack of data on safety and efficacy in this population [  ]   Drug�Drug and a0Drug�Food InteractionsGiven the range of comorbidities that may exist in patients with advanced HCC it is important to review all concomitant medications for potential interactions prior to initiation of treatment with cabozantinib Certain medications and foods have been shown to modulate the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib which may in turn impact exposure levels efficacy and risk of AEs Cabozantinib is metabolized in the liver primarily by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 CYP3A4 [] therefore CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may impact exposure examples of CYP3A4 inducersinhibitors are shown in Electronic Supplementary Table a0 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitorsinducers should be avoided in patients receiving cabozantinib If concomitant administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary

any food as this may affect absorption [] The label recommends that cabozantinib be taken at least  h before or at least  h after eating [] Grapefruit and grapefruit juice are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and should be avoided [ ]Cabozantinib may be used with caution in patients who are receiving concurrent antiarrhythmics or other QTprolonging agents [] This is based on a study of patients with MTC who received a daily 140mg capsule dose of cabozantinib recommended for this indication in which the mean deltadelta QT interval was increased by approximately � a0ms with upper  CIs not exceeding  ms [] Such an increase is within the range considered to be acceptable for oncology drugs in this setting [] No patient in the aforementioned study or in CELESTIAL had a confirmed QTcF QT corrected using Fridericia�s method a0 ms [] which is considered clinically significant [] For patients receiving cabozantinib monitoring with periodic electrocardiogram and electrolyte measurements may be advisable particularly in patients with risk factors such as cardiac disease or a prior history of QT prolongation [] Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors PPIs such as esomeprazole does not affect cabozantinib exposure levels [] However PPIs may cause hypomagnesemia which is linked to an increased risk of QT prolongation [] Therefore coadministration of PPIs and cabozantinib should be undertaken with caution following an individualized assessment of the patient�s baseline magnesium levels and concomitant medications that may also influence QT   Pretreatment AssessmentsGiven the heterogeneity of the HCC patient population and the complexity associated with comorbidities and concomitant medications all patients should undergo a comprehensive assessment of medical history prior to initiation of treatment with cabozantinib Ideally the multidisciplinary care team should include an oncology pharmacist [] A �brown bag� medication review should be carried out prior to treatment initiation [] whereby the patient brings in all current medications including overthecounter medicines vitamins herbal remedies etc Therapeutic duplications should be eliminated for example concomitant PPIs and histamine H2 antagonists H2 blockers Switching and deprescribing should be considered where possible to minimize the risk of drugdrug interactions   Adverse Event ManagementThe AE profile of cabozantinib is generally similar to that of other VEGFRtargeting TKIs with GIrelated AEs fatigue PPE and hypertension being the most common AEs [] Other AEs that occur less frequently can also have a significant impact on quality of life QoL and treatment adherence such as mucosal inflammation [] Hepatobiliary AEs such as elevated AST alanine aminotransferase ALT and bilirubin are particularly relevant in the context of advanced HCC and need to be carefully monitoredProphylactic and supportive care measures for the more common cabozantinibassociated AEs grade  or tolerable

Palmar�Plantar ErythrodysesthesiaPPE is one of the more common events associated with anticancer therapies including VEGFRtargeting multikinase inhibitors [�] PPE is characterized by pain redness tingling and swelling of hands and feet [] Presentation may vary according to the etiologic agent PPE induced by TKIs is typically localized to pressurebearing areas in contrast to that caused by chemotherapy which has a more diffuse pattern It has been hypothesized that inhibition of multiple angiogenic pathways by TKIs may compromise repair of capillary microtrauma in areas exposed to mechanical stress such as the hands and feet [ ] Although not lifethreatening PPE can rapidly progress to a debilitating condition negatively impacting QoL [ ]Prophylaxis and prompt management of emerging symptoms may help to minimize the impact of PPE on QoL and adherence Table a0 Prophylactic measures predominantly involve skin care practices to remove hyperkeratotic areas and to minimize

hypothesized thatnanoclays due to their high adhesive properties couldalso act as SARSCoV2 inhibitors They can do it bystrongly associating with the spike S present on SARSCoV2 The results obtained from the molecularlevelsimulations of the interactions indicate that due to veryhigh CED between SARSCoV2 and the nanoclays ascompared to the former and hACE2 Fig  they couldinhibit SARSCoV2 from

promote secondary adhesion mechanisms betweenhydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces [] It should alsobe noted that these clay nanops have high dispersion tendency due to their hydrophilic nature and relatively higher repulsive acidbase AB interactions Table High dispersion in turn results in the generation ofhigh surface area for increasing the attractive interactions Higher surface areas promote larger attractionsdue to the van der Waal attractions and the electrostaticforces among oppositely charged surfaces Besides although of relatively lesser degree positively chargededges of

theviruses into the cell by preventing the attachment of viruses to their target receptor on the cell Antibody binding can occur at different sites on the surface proteinleading to various mechanisms that cause the same effect In the case of SARSCoV2 two viral neutralizationmechanisms by antibodies have been observed [ ]and shown in Fig 1c d One of the mechanisms involvesdirect binding of

which are the elements that predict why a person is aging faster or slower and which interventionwe can arrange to slow down the process which permits to prevent or delay the progression of

identifying one or moremarkers which are able to describe aging processes These biomarkers are necessary to better define the agingrelated pathologies manage multimorbidity and improve the quality of

oldest region with  of thetotal population aged  and older However the Asia andLatin America older population is growing fast with Asia�solder population almost tripling in size from  million in to

by changes that take place at different levels ofbiological systems Biological age is of course influenced bychronological age but chronological age is by itself not representative of biological age

stressors [] If any definition of aging may appear incompleteand insufficient much more difficult and complex is to findthe marker or biomarker that can identify itMany theories currently trying to explain aging processesand many biomarkers are identified to measure aging and itsevolutionary stages Theories and biomarkers are not studiedto extend life span but to guide therapeutic choices and optimize patient management and personalization of careThe purpose of this paper is not purely to list which biomarkers are able to identify the various stages of aging ratherexplain how an epiphenomenon natural and physiological isso complex [] how many factors are protagonists in its development and how many actors and characters play in maximizing its individual features taking into account social andmorbidity biomarker These factors such as frailty loss ofautonomy essential needs and comorbidities influence theaging process and are able to justify why the biological ageof a person living in a country does not correspond to the ageof another person living in a country with better sociosanitaryconditionsClinical and Biological Aging PhenotypesThe aging phenotype can be described as a complex mosaicresulting from the interaction of a variety of environmentalstochastic and genetic�epigenetic eventsstimuli impinginglifelong on our body [ ]There is no clear evidence which molecular cellular orphysiological changes are the most important drivers of theaging process andor how they influence one another [] In itsbroadest sense aging merely refers to the changes that occurduring an anisms� life span though the rate at which thesetake place varies widely [] Despite its enormous complexityinvolving combinations of these variables a small number ofbasic molecular mechanisms underpin the aging process including a set of evolutionary highly conserved basic biological mechanisms responsible for body maintenance and repairOne of the key mechanisms is inflammation a typical featureof the aging process is the development of a chronic lowgrade inflammatory status named �inflammaging� [8cid129] whichemerged as critical in the pathogenesis of major agerelatedchronic diseases such as atherosclerosis type  diabetes and neuro degeneration Inflammaging plays a pivotal role in themost important geriatric conditions such as sarc ia [9cid129cid129]osteoporosis [] frailty and disability thus contributing tomortality [] Interestingly a variety of tissues adipose tissue muscle ans brain liver systems immune systemand ecosystems gut microbiota of the body indicated as�subsystems� can contribute to the onset and progressionof such a systemic inflammatory state [] by increasing theproduction of several proinflammatory mediators or loweringthat of the antiinflammatory ones [8cid129]To differentiate the innocuous changes from those leadingto increased risk of disease disability or death biogerontologists tend to use a more precise term�senescence�when describing aging [] Senescence is thereforethe progressive deterioration of bodily functions over time andnormal human aging has been associated with a loss of complexity in a wide range of physiological processes and anatomic structures [] including blood pressure [] strideintervals [] respiratory cycles [] and vision [] amongothers such as postural dynamics [] ultimately leading todecreased fertility and increased risk or mortality []Systemic consequences of aging are widespread but theycan be clustered into four domains Fig � Changing in body composition�The balance between energy availability and energydemandSignaling networks that maintain homeostasis�� NeurodegenerationThese changes develop in parallel and affect each otherthrough many feedforward and feedback loopThe phenotype that results from the aging process is characterized by increased susceptibility to disease high risk ofmultiple coexisting diseases impaired response to stress theemergence of �geriatric syndromes� altered response to treatment high risk of disability and loss of personal autonomywith all its psychological and social consequences On theother hand all these factors influence aging itself in a dynamic and parallel way so that they can be considered as not onlya consequence of aging but also an integral part of the agingprocessTheories of AgingHuman aging is currently defined as a dynamic process involving the continual adaptation of the body to lifelong exposure tointernal and external damaging as conceptualized in the �remodelling theory of aging� [21cid129cid129] Theories of aging are generallyclassified as either program or damage theories Programmedaging theories suggest that there is a deliberate deterioration withage because a limited life span results in evolutionary benefits[] This plan could be a result of �aging genes� The firstdescribed mutation to yield a significant extension in the life spanof Caenorhabditis elegans was in the ageI gene which wasshown to result in a  increase in mean life span and a increase in maximum life span of this anism []Evolutionary biologists may argue that aging occurs due to theabsence of natural selection at the postreproductive stage of life[] Although such aging theories are subjectively appealing asthey convey a cure for aging the accumulation of damage is aspontaneous entropydriven process [] Among the damage 0cCurr Oncol Rep            Fig  Systemic consequences ofagingPage  of     theories a prevailing idea is that of oxidative damage Reactiveoxygen species ROS are generated during metabolism throughseveral interrelated reactions The supposition that aging may becaused by ROS has been further substantiated by studies involving transgenic animals for genes encoding antioxidants The lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster has been extended by overexpression of both superoxide dismutase SOD and catalase bothantioxidant enzymes [] Since mitochondria are the major producer of ROS in mammalian cells mitochondrial DNAmtDNA is therefore particularly susceptible to oxidative damage [] Mitochondrial maintenance is therefore essential topreserve cellular homeostasis and impaired mitochondrial maintenance has been described as a shared hallmark of numeroushuman pathologies and aging [] Mitochondrial DNA varieswith age and it is commonly considered that DNA hypomethylation is a typical aspect of the aging process [] ROS are activeintermediates of DNA methylation as well as histone modification These reactive oxygen species may play a role in epigeneticprocesses physiological phenotypic variations caused by external or environmental factors that switch genes onoff throughreactions of nucleophilic substitution at the DNA levelConsequently it has been suggested that better preservation ofDNA methylation levels slower cell metabolism and improvedcontrol in signal transmission through epigenetic mechanismscould be key processes involved in human longevity Oxidativedamage to proteins is irreversible and irreparable [] and mustbe degraded by the proteasome The proteasome is the mostimportant proteolytic machinery in eukaryotic cells largely responsible for the removal of oxidized proteins and the preventionof its aggregation [] However it has been shown that theactivity of proteasome is impaired during aging leading to theaccumulation of oxidizing proteins aggresome and lipofuscinsocalled the age pigment Similarly to oxidative damage nitrosamine damage�that caused by reactive nitrogen speciesRNS such as nitric oxide�has been suggested to also contribute to agerelated diseases namely hepatic steatosis and apoptosis [] as well as functional and structural changes in the cardiovascular system [ ] sleep homeostasis [] psychological disorders [] and dementia []Most supporters of the genomic instability theory of agingrefer to telomere shortening [] and mutation in DNA mitochondrial Telomeres are the repeated DNA sequences at theends of linear chromosomes which are unable to be fullyreplicated by DNA polymerasesMutations in mtDNA cause a wide range of human mitochondrial diseases and have been implicated in agerelateddiseases and agingBiomarker FeaturesFinding the biomarker of aging is one of the most importantgoals of medicine The National Institutes of HealthBiomarkers Definitions Working Group defined a biomarkeras �a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluatedas an indicator of normal biological processes pathogenicprocesses or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention� []The American Federation for Aging Research AFAR recommends the following criteria for biomarkers of aging [39cid129]It must predict a person�s physiological cognitive andphysical function in an agerelated way independentlyof chronological age 0c    Page  of Curr Oncol Rep            It must be testable and not harmful to test subjects forexample a blood test or an imaging

humanssince preliminary testing is always done in nonhumansubjectsFerrucci et al reviewed the biomarkers proposed as elements of a theory based on the balance between �resiliencemechanisms� and �accumulated damages� where biomarkersact in reducing resilience mechanisms or increasing damages[40cid129] Tables  and The pathways eligible to become biomarkers are thefollowingGenomic Instability Endogenous and exogenous agents continuously challenge the integrity of DNA when DNA repairmechanisms cannot manage the repeated damage the result isan accumulation of DNA somatic mutations This phenomenon causes dysregulation of gene expression and the production of altered proteins that lead to cellular damage Somaticmutation accumulation has been observed in skeletal musclecells neurons and lymphocytes B related to aging [�]nevertheless quantification of DNA repair capacity in humanshas yet to be finalized [�]Telomere Attrition Telomeres are the DNA sequences that areplaced at the

circulating cells however no techniqueshave been validated for evaluating aging because of the heterogeneity between different cells between individuals andhigh measurement errors that make these techniques not yetvalid in clinical practice [�]Epigenetic Alterations Epigenetics refers to those mechanismsexternal to DNA that modulate gene expression in cells theregulation of gene expression determines the phenotypic characteristics of the different cells and tissues The main mechanismsare DNA methylation histone modification and noncodingRNA While DNA methylation is easily measured in circulatingcells and seems to be correlated to aging [ ] measuringhistone modification or noncoding RNA is difficult and expensive Recent evidence correlates DNA methylation with agingand agerelated

be agood biomarker but to date there are no valid techniques forthis purposeMitochondrial Dysfunction The main role of mitochondria isto guarantee energy for the cell through the production ofATP They are also involved in signaling by the productionof ROS and in apoptosisprogrammed cell deathMitochondrial dysfunction is a good biomarker of aging andis associated with disability in older persons through the reduction of muscle strength [65cid129]Many techniques are measuring oxidative phosphorylationand ROS generation that have been associated with chronicdisease [ ] nevertheless the relation with aging is notcompletely validatedCellular Senescence Genomic instability telomere shorteningand other endogenous and exogenous mechanisms can inducethe cell to activate specific pathways that lead to apoptosis[] This process is called cellular senescence and is characterized by structural and functional changes in the cell []Senescent cells produce proinflammatory cytokines andchemokines growth factors and matrix proteases called �senescenceassociated secretory phenotype� SASP [ ]which may induce some agerelated diseases [�] Thedetection of SASP has been proposed as a biomarker of aging[]Deregulated NutrientSensing Genetic mutations in growthhormone and the insulinlike growth factor have been linkedto longevity [] Moreover dietary restriction showed to increase life span in primates [ ] For these reasons thispathway has been proposed as biomarkers of agingSteam Cell Exhaustion The decline in the regenerative potential is one of the elements at the base of aging [] Despitepharmacological interventions being explored to counteractthis phenomenon [] evidences are still poor 0c    Page  of Curr Oncol Rep            Altered Intercellular Communication With aging we also observe changes in intercellular communication as inflammatory reaction increases the other communication ways becomedysfunctional endocrine neuronal immune system []As we discussed earlier inflammation can be inappropriately increased in aging and this has been related to agerelated disease [ ]Indeed the pathways described as potential biomarkers ofaging are strongly related to inflammation for this reasonmeasuring circulating levels of cytokines is considered anew field of research [ 84cid129 ]Aging and Life ExpectancyAging and life expectancy are closely related In a broadsense determining an individual�s life expectancy is also away of schematizing his or her aging process Life expectancyis a statistical measure of the average time an anism isexpected to live based on the year of its birth LEB itscurrent age and demographic factors including gender []In the last decades life expectancy has increased in high income country the rise in human life expectancy has involveddeclines in intrinsic and extrinsic mortality processes associated respectively with senescence and environmental challenges []In association to this increased longevity there are diseasescalled agerelated that increase quadratically with age andcause a progressive loss of physical mental and cognitiveintegrities leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to morbidity mortality [] and disability in additionto increasing care needs and agerelated burden measuredthrough the sum of disabilityadjusted life years DALYs ofthese diseases among these adults Fig  Ninetytwo of the of the Global Burden of Disease causes were identified asagerelated diseases In particular cardiovascular diseaseneoplasm and chronic respiratory disorders are those withhigher agerelated disease burden []Determinants of Frailty Syndrome as AgingBiomarkerFrailty can be defined as a state of increased vulnerabilityto stressors or a loss of capacity to resolve homeostasisperturbation Frailty condition is closely related to aging[88cid129cid129] and the frailty indexes can consequently be considered biomarkers of aging themselves In frail individuals it is possible to find both changing in body composition and balance between energy availability and energydemand Moreover in the definition of frailty it is welldescribed how signaling networks maintain homeostasisand association with neurodegeneration These fouraspects all refer to the hallmarks of aging Frailty is associated with adverse clinical outcomes including falls institutionalization and death [88cid129cid129]Two principal models emerged in the last decades that areable to conceptualize and consequently measure frailty in everyday clinical practice and research the �frailty phenotype�model and the cumulative deficits modelThe frailty phenotype was first described by Fried and colleagues in  analyzing data from the CardiovascularHealth Study CHS involving  men and women aged years and older In this study it was investigated whichcharacteristics of the population were predictive of falls disability hospitalization and death Their operational definitionof frailty included a cluster of at least three of the followingvariables unintentional weight loss selfreported exhaustionlow energy expenditure slow gait speed and weak gripstrength This model does not take into consideration cognitive impairment as a cause of increased vulnerability as thiscould contribute to functional decline and adverse events inolder people [ ]The cumulative deficits model was developed byRockwood and colleagues as part of the prospectiveCanadian Study of Health and Aging CSHA involvinga cohort of  older adults [] The authors identified  parameters including diseases disabilities signssymptoms and laboratory values which were defined as�deficits� The sum of the deficits in a single individualallowed for the calculation of a frailty index ie thenumber of deficits divided by  Frailty in this modelis not considered as a cluster of symptoms but is conceptualized as a gradable syndrome with a higher number ofdeficits implying an increased vulnerability state The twomodels of frailty show significant overlap although theycapture slightly different sides of the same problem It isimportant to notice that physical frailty is frequently associated with multimorbidity [ 93cid129 ]It has been observed that the frailty phenotype construct is intrinsically related to mobility issues Indeedin older adults physical performance measures are a robust and consistent predictor for disability hospitalization institutionalization and death both in the researchand in the clinical setting Lower physical performance isfrequently associated with loss of skeletal muscle massand quality causing reduced strength and functional impairment [95cid129cid129] This process has been called sarc iaEven though sarc ia has been long associated withaging it has to be acknowledged that it can develop muchearlier in life [] Different definitions exist for this condition for the operational definition of sarc ia both inthe clinic and for research purposes that prioritize theassessment of muscle strength over muscle mass to identity sarc ic patients Strength is more closely related tosurvival and functional decline compared with muscle 0cCurr Oncol Rep

by overlapping comorbidities common to both OSA and CKD[] The cooccurrence of both CKD and OSA is associated with increasedcardiovascular events and allcause mortality [�] Usually OSA develops inpatients with CKD independent of underlying renal dysfunction but someevidence shows that CKD can cause or exacerbate OSA and central sleep apneaProposed mechanisms for this causal relationship

mouse salivary tissues []Cell Detection MethodsThe following methods have been used for detecting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cells of human and animal tissue RNAseq N   IHC N   RTPCR N   in a0situ hybridization ISH N   and WB N   Different detection approaches were used in  studies [ ] One study reported specific genetic analysis [] There were significant differences between studies regarding methods used While Ziegler et a0al and Sungnak et a0al detected ACE2 by RNAseq in goblet cells Lee et a0al did not find any immunohistochemical labeling [  ] However the results reported in sustentacular cells agree in the same direction whatever the technique used whether by RNAseq or by ISH and immunocytochemistry [�] The discrepancies are rather observed between studies having performed immunohistochemistry Indeed using two different antibodies Hikmet did not find ACE2 expression in nasopharynx epithelium whereas others demonstrated the staining of the apical surface of epithelia and ciliated epithelial cells [  ] Interestingly all the studies which carried out RNAseq found an expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 at the epithelial level which implies that the technique used could generate biases between the studies [ � �] 0cHead and Neck Pathology DiscussionThe presentation of COVID19 infection may be in several clinical forms ranging from anosmia in isolation to severe multiple an failure and death The mechanisms underlying the COVID19 polymorphism are still unknown To infect tissues SARSCoV2 needs to entry into the cells which is allowed through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors [] The identification of virus receptor expression in the tissues makes particularly sense to better understand the clinical expression of the disease This systematic review sheds light on many pointsFirst ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors are expressed in epithelial and nonepithelial cells throughout the head and neck The head and neck expression may support the otolaryngological clinical picture of the disease which was recently found in European and North American COVID patients [   ] By entering the body via the epithelial cells of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa the SARSCoV2 virus leads to an inflammatory reaction and the development of otolaryngological symptoms Nasal entrance of the virus through high ACE2 expression was supported in the study of Wu et a0al who found a higher virus concentration in nasal swabs compared with throat swabs []The olfactory cleft is a nasal region that has drawn the attention of many researchers over the past few weeks Indeed recent data supported that more than  of COVID19 patients developed subjective olfactory dysfunction especially when patients suffered from mildtomoderate forms of the disease [   ] Because ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in the nasal mucosa of the olfactory cleft entrance into the olfactory bulb seems plausible Once in the bulb according to some human studies [ ] the virus could infect cells that express ACE2 or TMPRSS2 namely glial and neuronal stem cells Fig a0Integrating the molecular clinical and radiological characteristics of SARSCOV2 olfactory loss may shed light about its pathophysiological process Taking into account that the loss is often temporary SARSCOV2 may primarily infect the sustentacular cells supporting the olfactory sensory neurons This infection may cause rapid disruption of the olfactory epithelium structure and function with a possible inflammatory response inducing sudden onset smell loss This inflammation is observed in a minority of patient with congested olfactory cleft who underwent CT scan [   �]ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also found in horizontal basal olfactory stem cells located in the basal layer They are less exposed to the external environment thus less likely to be infected in first line the loss would have been more Fig    Epithelium of Olfactory Cleft The figure summarizes the olfactory cleft epithelium 0c Head and Neck Pathologyprogressive However once infected they might slow down recovery time because horizontal basal cells give rise to many cell type in the olfactory epithelium They may also contribute to virus spread to the olfactory bulb vascular pericytes Magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies of the olfactory bulb [ ] in which ACE2 are only expressed in vascular pericytes but not in neurons may show inflammatory signs suggesting that the infection process can extend more centrally and promote inflammatory response [] Inflammatory causes are often quickly reversible for example after a oneweek trial of high dose of corticosteroids or simply days after the resolution of the viral infection suggesting that the olfactory neurons and bulbs are still somewhat intact This seems to be the case for a majority of patients In contrast with more sustained destruction of neuronal olfactory structures the recovery time is much longer and may take � a0years given the slow neuroregeneration process [ ]In this systematic review we found that three studies reported high ACE2 expression in major or minor salivary gland human tissues [  ] These data corroborate the literature findings that reported a salivary pattern of SARSCoV2 and related parotitis [ ] Moreover the virus spread into the salivary gland tissues allows us a better understanding the mechanisms underlying salivary transmission Interestingly in  Liu et a0al observed that monkeys infected by SARSCoV had a salivary viral spread which was associated with a salivary virion excretion [] These data support the need to conduct future studies investigating the presence of SARSCoV2 in the saliva of infected human and to corroborate the saliva findings with the ACE2 salivary gland expressionThe head and neck expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and the related otolaryngological symptom pattern seems obvious but could vary across individuals and populations In support of this Lee et a0al observed that ACE2 expression is influenced by patient demographics clinical characteristics comorbidities and medication [] As reported in the genetic analysis of Cao et a0al there would be different susceptibilities or responses to SARSCoV2 in different populations [] The polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression could explain the clinical differences between individuals Indeed many physicians reported in clinical and epidemiological studies different clinical presentation of the disease [ ] which could be associated with virus mutations [  ] The virus mutations and the related impact on receptor binding and infectivity is another point that has to be considered in future studies Otherwise according to the Bgee database https bgee expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 evaluated in murine models may increase with age These findings have to be confirmed in humans but could explain more severe clinical pictures in the elderlyThe present study has several limitations First the heterogeneity between studies about the detection method may lead to detection bias as some approaches are more sensitive than others Some studies interrogate gene expression at mRNA level and others at protein levels both types of analysis having their advantages and limitations Compared to transcriptomic analyzes immunohistochemistry brings additional important spatial information in tissue samples but recently Sorokin et a0al demonstrated high and statistically significant correlations between the RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical measurements [] Interestingly they highlighted the complementarity of both techniques for measuring cancer biomarkers in FFPE samples However differences observed across IHC studies suggest the involvement of many parameters The antibody specificity is a big challenge to ensure reproducibility of antibodybased studies and given the high homology between ACE1 and ACE2 cautions must be taken regarding antibody selection Besides a report from the International Working Group for Antibody Validation IWGAV proposed five scientific approaches to validate antibody specificity [] then such strategies must be considered in future investigations to confirm the published observations In addition it seems essential to enlarge and diversify patient cohorts and to combine transcriptomic and proteomic strategies as well as colocalize different markers of SARSCoV2 such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to provide an accurate representation of ACE2 expression through all head and neck areas of the whole populationSecond the majority of studies that were conducted during the SARSCoV2 pandemic did not consider many demographic and clinical factors such as the age of patients from who the tissues were extracted or the use of ACE inhibitor medications among others Third some otolaryngological regions remain uninvestigated such as the vocal folds The investigation of these remaining regions may shed further light on some recently reported unusual clinical phenomena such as severe dysphonia []ConclusionACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in head and neck tissues which may explain the otolaryngological clinical pattern of the disease and the entry of SARSCoV2 into the host anism Future studies considering demographical and clinical characteristics of patients from who the tissues are extracted are needed to better understand the cell entry mechanisms of SARSCoV2Author contributions

normal tissues Theselenium concentrations in synovial ﬂuid and plasma of OA patients were not significantly different from thoseof  healthy controls106 Similarly no significant difference in selenium concentration was noted between sixdogs with posttraumatic OA and six control dogs107Second the beneﬁcial effect of selenium supplementationin alleviating OA symptoms has been debated The resultsfrom a controlled doubleblind trial of  patientsOfﬁcial journal of the Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biologyrevealed that the supplementation of a formulation containing selenium with vitamins A C and E SeACE didnot have any remarkable curative effect compared to aplacebo108 In a study with an independent cohort theprevalence of radiographic knee OA was not significantlyassociated

��Conclusions  A previous study reported that the average number of CNVR per goat breed was    CNVR50 breeds which is much smaller than the number we found here  CNVR We attribute this difference to the fact that the previous study included multiple caprine breeds that were represented by small to moderate numbers of individuals Given the low frequencies of CNV in our study the average frequency of CNV is  such a design would probably underestimate the levels of the diversity of CNV at the within�breed level We also observed that functions related with sensory perception metabolism and embryo development are overrepresented in the set of genes that overlapped with CNV and that these loci often belong to large multigene families with tens hundreds or thousands of paralogous members a

disease  []  is  caused  by  the segregation of CNV Genome scans to detect structural variations  in  cattle  have  revealed  that  CNV  regions CNVR are often enriched in genes that are involved in immunity [�] metabolism [ ] embryo development [ ] and sensory perception [ ] There is evidence that the  dNdS ratios of genes that map to taurine CNV are generally higher than those of genes that do not overlap with CNV which indicates that CNV genes probably evolve under reduced selective constraint [] The analysis of gene networks has also shown that genes that  colocalize  with  duplications  tend  to  have  fewer interactions with other genes than loci that do not overlap  with  CNV  reinforcing  the  idea  that  genes  mapping to duplicated regions have fewer essential housekeeping functions  than  nonCNV  genes  and  also  have  reduced pleiotropy []Although structural chromosomal variations can have strong  effects  on  gene  expression  and  phenotypic  variability  technical  limitations  and  the  moderate  quality of genome assemblies have hampered CNV mapping in livestock  []  Until  recently  this  has  been  particularly true for goats In  Fontanesi et a0al [] published the first  caprine  CNV  map  by  identifying  with  the  Bovine a0k aCGH array  CNVR including  and  copy loss and gain variants respectively Later on resequencing  the  genome  of  individuals  from  several  caprine breeds  made  it  possible  to  identify  CNV  that  overlap with  pigmentation genes and to detect an association between increased ASIP copy number and light pigmentation  []  The  first  worldwide  survey  of  copy  number  variation  in  goats  was  performed  within  the  Goat ADAPTmap Project httpwwwgoata daptm ap and involved the genomewide genotyping of  goats from  breeds [] This study resulted in the identification of  CNVR among which several overlapped with genes that  are  functionally  related  with  local  adaptation  such as coat color muscle development metabolic processes and embryonic development [] Moreover the patterns of the diversity of CNV differed according to geographic origin  which  indicates  that  they  have  been  influenced by population history [] In another study on  individuals from  East African goat breeds Nandolo et a0al [] detected  CNVR More recently Henkel et a0al [] demonstrated the existence of complex patterns of structural variation in the regions containing the caprine ASIP and KIT genes with potential causal effects on pigmentation In spite of these efforts the description of structural chromosomal  variation  in  goats  is  still  lagging  behind that of other domestic species Most of the CNV surveys in goats have analyzed large populations that represent a mixture of different breeds each with a limited number of individuals [ ] thus making it difficult to assess the magnitude of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level Our goal was to fill this gap by analyzing a population of  individuals from a single Spanish breed MurcianoGranadina  and  to  investigate  the  functional  roles  of genes that map to CNVR and compare these results with data obtained in

BeadChip analysis 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of DiscussionIn this work our aim was to characterize copy number variation  in  MurcianoGranadina  goats  a  native  Spanish breed used for milk production By genotyping  MurcianoGranadina  goats  with  a  SNP  array  we  were able  to  identify    CNVR  covering    of  the  goat genome  whereas  Liu  et a0 al  []  identified  CNVR  that covered   of the goat genome The latter higher percentage reported by Liu et a0al [] can be explained by the fact that they analyzed  breeds with different geographical  origins  ie  a  composite  population  that  is probably much more diverse than that used in our work Besides  the  pipeline  that  we  used  to  identify  CNVR is more stringent than that employed by Liu et a0al [] removing CNVR that were not consistently detected by PennCNV and QuantiSNP In the literature estimates of  to  for CNVR coverage in the human genome are reported [] Our results and those obtained by Liu et a0al [] are consistent with these valuesIndeed  when  Liu  et a0 al  []  calculated  the  CNVR length  for  each  breed  normalized  by  the  goat  genome size their results agreed well with our estimate of  For  instance  this  parameter  reached  values  of   in  goats  from  Southeastern  Africa  and    in  goats from  Northwestern  Africa  and  Eastern  Mediterranean whereas it was lowest  for individuals from West Asia  []  The  number  of  CNV  detected  at  the  withinbreed  level  by  Liu  et a0 al  []  was  on  average    CNV per breed and ranged from  to  whereas the average number of CNVR was only   per breed [] Since the number of detected CNVR is proportional to population size for most of the breeds investigated in [] the level of withinbreed CNV variation is probably underestimated In summary one important conclusion from our study is that the magnitude of CNV diversity at the withinbreed  level  is  likely  to  be  much  larger  than  that previously  reported  in  studies  that  analyzed  multiple populations  each  represented  by  a  small  or  moderate number of individualsMost of the CNVR that we report here ranged in size from  to a0kb with a mean size of a0kb Similarly the average CNVR size reported by Liu et a0al [] was a0kb Both estimates are quite large and reflect that mediumdensity SNP arrays are not well suited to detect small CNVR in spite of their high abundance In cattle the  average  sizes  of  CNVR  detected  with  the  Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip a0K SNPs [] Illumina wholegenome sequencing and PacBio sequencing []  were      and  a0 kb  respectively  Another consistent feature of CNVR is that in general their frequencies are low or very low In our study approximately   of  the  CNVR  had  frequencies  lower  than    and the average frequency was  Liu et a0al [] reported lower  CNVR  frequencies  ranging  from    Alpine and  Northern  European  goats  to    Northwestern African goats This decreased average CNVR frequency is  not  very  significant  and  probably  reflects  differences in  sampling  size  and  the  use  of  composite  populations with  multiple  breeds  each  one  with  its  specific  CNVR frequenciesThe CNVR detected in our study covered  proteincoding  genes  Pathway  analyses  reflected  a  substantial enrichment  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  olfactory  perception  which  is  consistent  with  previous  reports  in cattle [ ] In this regard there is an important difference between our results and those by Liu et a0al [] Whereas in the study of Liu et a0al [] the term �sensory perception� was underrepresented among the CNV genes fold enrichment   in our work the terms �olfactory transduction�  fold  enrichment    and  �Gprotein coupled  purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity�  fold enrichment    were  overrepresented  and  many CNV  genes  were  olfactory  receptors  The  two  terms mentioned  before  are  closely  related  because  a  broad array of purinergic receptors are differentially expressed in  the  olfactory  receptor  neurons  that  modulate  odor responsiveness  []  Moreover  purinergic  nucleotides are  important  neuromodulators  of  peripheral  auditory and visual sensory systems [] In cattle Keel et a0al [] reported that �sensory perception of smell� and �Gprotein  coupled  receptor  signaling  pathway�  were  significantly overrepresented in the proteincoding genes that overlapped  with  CNVR  Similarly  Upadhyay  et a0 al  [] showed that �sensory perceptions of smell� and �chemical  stimuli�  are  enriched  in  their  set  of  CNV  genes  A potential  explanation  for  the  underrepresentation  of the �sensory perception� functional category among the genes overlapping CNV reported by Liu et a0al [] could be that in goats these genes are not well annotated yet so the majority of them are identified with a LOC prefix and a number and as a consequence of this they are not  correctly  detected  by  PANTHER  []  thus  biasing the  results  obtained  in  the  gene  ontology  enrichment analysisLoci  belonging  to  large  multigene  families  might  be more  prone  to  colocalize  with  CNV  because  paralogous  genes  can  act  as  templates  in  nonallelic  homologous  recombination  events  which  promote  increases or  reductions  in  copy  number  []  It  should  be  noted that olfactory receptor genes constitute the largest gene superfamily  and  in  humans  more  than    genes  and pseudogenes  have  been  identified  []  In  cattle   olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes are distributed in    clusters  across    bovine  chromosomes  []  and similar numbers have been reported for pigs [] Moreover  purifying  selection  against  CNV  is  probably  less  0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of intense in regions that contain olfactoryreceptor genes than in genomic regions that contain genes with essential functions [] Interestingly copy number changes in the olfactory receptor genes of wild and domestic mammals might have consequences on food foraging as well as on mate and predator recognition [ ]In the set of genes that colocalize with CNVR we also detected  an  enrichment  of  loci  related  with  the  multigene  family  of  ATP  binding  cassette  ABC  transporters  a  result  that  agrees  well  with  previous  findings  in humans  [�]  and  cattle  [  ]  In  mammals  ABC transporters fulfill the mission of carrying a broad array of endogenous substrates such as amino acids peptides sugars anions and hydrophobic compounds and metabolites  across  lipid  membranes  At  least    ABC  genes that belong to eight subfamilies have been identified in the human genome [] Copy number variation in the human ABCC4 and ABCC6 genes is associated with susceptibility  to  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  [] and to the rare autosomal recessive disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum [] respectively Moreover largescale deletions of the human ABCA1 gene are a causative factor  for  hypoalphalipoproteinemia  []  a  disease  that  is characterized by the complete absence of the apolipoprotein AI and extremely low levels of plasma highdensity lipoprotein  HDL  cholesterol  We  also  found  a  highly significant enrichment of pathways related with embryo development  anteriorposterior  pattern  specification embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis as previously reported [] These pathways are featured by genes that belong to the Hox multigene family of transcription factors possibly reflecting the genomic instability of certain homeobox gene clusters as evidenced by the existence of many syntenyparalogy breakpoints and assembly gaps as outlined in comparative studies []Although  not  significant  after  correction  for  multiple testing  we  detected  an  enrichment  of  pathways  with metabolic  significance  such  as  prolactin  and  insulin signaling which could have an impact on milk production  and  growth  [�]  Interestingly  the  comparison of our work with that of Liu et a0al [] revealed  proteincoding genes that colocalize with the set of shared CNVR One of the most relevant shared genes encodes ASIP a protein that increases the ratio of pheomelanin to  eumelanin  by  binding  to  the  melanocortin    receptor  and  delivering  an  antagonist  signal  that  blocks  the downstream expression of eumelanogenic enzymes [] Mutations in the ASIP gene play critical roles in animal pigmentation [] For instance the causal factor of the white color typical of many sheep breeds is the ubiquitous expression of a duplicated copy of the ASIP coding sequence  which  is  regulated  by  a  duplicated  promoter corresponding  to  the  itchy  E3  ubiquitin  protein  ligase gene  [  ]  Although  some  studies  proposed  that  the ASIP CNV might be associated with different pigmentation patterns in goats [  ] no functional assay has verified an association of ASIP copy number with ASIP mRNA  levels  Another  interesting  shared  copy  number variable gene is ADAMTS20 which was also identified in two previous CNV surveys [ ] This gene encodes a metalloproteinase with an important role in melanoblast survival by mediating Kit signaling [] and in palatogenesis [] Bertolini et a0al [] performed a selection scan in white vs colored black and red goats and detected a selective sweep in the ADAMTS20 gene In the light of these  results  the  potential  involvement  of  a  structural variation  in  ADAMTS20  in  goat  pigmentation  should be explored further Moreover it is worthwhile to mention that several CNVR genes have functions related with production  and  reproduction  traits  For  instance  the NCKAP5 gene which colocalizes with CNVR_160_chr2 frequency   is associated with milk fat percentage in  cattle  []  Taking  the  above  evidence  into  account the implication of structural chromosomal variations in the  genetic  determinism  of  traits  of  economic  interest with a complex inheritance deserves further exploration by designing tools that allow inferring CNVR genotypes with high confidenceConclusionsWith  the  PennCNV  and  QuantiSNP  software  we detected    CNVR  in  the  genome  of  the  MurcianoGranadina  breed  In  a a0 previous  study  []  that  used  a less  stringent  pipeline  only  PennCNV  was  used  and included  multiple  populations  with  small  to  moderate  sample  sizes  the  average  number  of  CNVR  events per breed was   One conclusion of our study is that CNV surveys which are based on a broad array of breeds represented  by  only  a  few  individuals  underestimate the true levels of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level The main reason for this outcome is that since the majority of CNV have very low frequencies they cannot be detected efficiently when sample size is small and in consequence  much  of  the  existing  variation  is  missed We have also found that genes that overlap with CNV are functionally related with olfactory transduction embryo development  ABC  transporters  and  Gprotein  coupled purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity  Most  of  these genes  belong  to  large  multigene  families  encompassing tens  hundreds  or  thousands  of  paralogous  genes  that could act as substrates in nonallelic homologous recombination  events  which  is  one  of  the  main  mechanisms generating  duplications  and  deletions  in  humans  and other  species  Finally  we  detected  CNV  that  colocalize with the ASIP and ADAMTS20 pigmentation genes 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol

Type diabetes mellitusBackgroundDiabetes mellitus DM is one of the most prevalent chronic noncommunicable diseases NCD around the world about  of the patients who have diabetes sufferfrom Type  DM T2DM [] The risk of developing T2DM is strongly associated withmany predispositions behavioral and environmental risk factors and also genetic factors [�] Besides the genetic factors strong evidence indicates that factors such asobesity and physical inactivity are the main nongenetic determinants of the disease [] T2DM can range from predominant insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to dominant defective secretion with insulin resistance [] It is often related tometabolic syndrome problems Individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance arehighrisk subjects of type  diabetes []Studies demonstrate a drastic increase of the disease in recent decades The trendsestimate that by  more than  million people will be affected by the disease []People who suffer from T2DM are susceptible to many forms of complications leadingto morbidity and mortality in these patients Many studies emphasize the genetic factors in the pathogenesis of T2DM [  ] Long noncoding RNAs long ncRNAslncRNA are subsets of RNA specified as being transcripts with lengths exceeding nucleotides that could not be translated into protein [] Long noncoding RNAslncRNAs belong to a heterogeneous class of regulatory lncRNAs with transcriptlengths   nucleotides which have a positive role in the development and growth ofseveral various diseases including T2DM supporting the hypothesis that abnormal expression of LncRNAs is related to various diseases [] Besides considering the significant role of lncRNAs in disease pathogenesis increasing researches suggest using themto improve diagnosis prognosis and clinical management of T2DM Genomewide association studies GWAS have recently introduced several particular diabetesrelatedloci in the human genome [] Also many studies discovered the relationship betweenmore than  susceptible loci and T2DM at a genomewide significant level [  ]Deregulation of genes located in GWAS defined loci may be risk factors for human diseases

thevarious data mining techniques For the implementation of the algorithms we usedANACONDA3�  bit a free and  source platform distribution of pythonprogramming language with a vast number of modules packages and rich libraries thatprovide various methods for classification problems For obtaining the best amount ofperformance in the models 10fold crossvalidation performed on the dataset In dealing with the small data sets crossvalidation is a prominent strategy for estimating theperformance CrossValidation is a performance evaluation technique commonly usedin practice Here the data set is repeatedly partitioned into two nonoverlapping partsa training set and a holdout set For each partitioning the holdout set is used fortesting while the remainder is used for training The two most popular variants aretenfold crossvalidation 10fold CV where the data is split into ten mutually disjointfolds []Since our samples were more than  and to be sure that each fold contains thesame proportion of healthy and diabetic individuals we used the stratified 10foldcrossvalidation approach [] Therefore the results are reliable and more credibleWe applied four popular data mining approaches on the lncRNA variables regression knearest neighbors SVM and neural network classification algorithmsKNN algorithmThe knearest neighbor�s algorithm kNN is an algorithm for classifying variables regarding the closest training data in the feature space KNN uses an instancebasedlearning method which is one of the simplest algorithms among data mining techniques This method considers the nearest neighbors to each object and decides todedicate the object to classes [ ]SVM algorithmSupport Vector Machine SVM is a supervised algorithm which divides the featurespace called hyperplanes considering the target classes SVM computes classification bymaximizing the margin of the hyperplane that intercepts classes This algorithm plots amultidimensional hyperplane that divides classes and increases the margin betweenclasses to enhance the accuracy of classification We used different kernel functionsembedded in the SVM class of SVC library in python framework as a quadratic polynomial radial basis etc to classify the instance and to detect the best accuracy amongthem [�]Artificial neural networkArtificial Neural Network is a data processing algorithm that simulates the biologicalneural network in its computations A common problem in using ANN is that they actfundamentally as a black box and the parameters are set by the model so we cannotdemonstrate them [] we can just apply the model in our problems and obtain thehigh performance We used Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN Thestructure of a multilayer perceptron neural network has been demonstrated in

for classification of new input in each neuron the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype is calculated The input is dedicated to aclass when it has more similar to that class than the other classesLogistic regressionLogistic regression is a common approach for predictive modeling practices The functionpX provides probability output between  and  for all values of X where X1�Xp are

studies and our data mining analysiswas implemented in their studies The data were collected from  unrelated Iraniansubjects  T2DM patients and  healthy individuals matched for age and sexT2DM patients were recruited from individuals who referred to the Diabetic Clinic atShohada Hospital Tehran Iran In the current study we applied six lncRNAs expression and also six demographic variables including sex age weight height BMI andFBS for analysis and inputs of algorithms For the preprocessing phase we normalizedthe data inputs for KNN SVM and ANN models We also had low missing variablesand we replaced them with zero Table lncRNA extraction and selectionIncreasing evidence has suggested several lncRNAs are implicated in T2DM pathogenesis Recently human βcell transcriptome analysis showed lncRNAs dynamic regulation and abnormal expression of lncRNAs in T2DM [] However the extent oflncRNA deregulation in T2DM has yet to be determined To date more than100 susceptibility loci have been identified as being associated with T2DM at a genomewidesignificant level [ ] Considering this into account and by querying the GWAS catalog we candidated  lncRNAs LY86AS1 HCG27_201 LINC00523 LINC00994TPT1AS1and DKFZP as target genes for this studyThe large scale GWAS have recognized approximately  SNPs that were susceptibleto T2DM [] From there we used the GWAS catalog access in June  to create alist of SNPs associated with T2DM In the current study we selected six lncRNA forexpression analysis according to the scan carried out in the study of Mansoori  []and Saeedi  [] We selected variants that had associations with increased risk ofT2DM We applied a quantitative PCR analysis of lncRNA expression levels in the samples We calculated the respective amount of each lncRNAs

of the disease was the primary purpose of ourresearchRegardless of high number of lncRNAs in the RNA profile of human a few numbersof them has been proved to be biologically active The role of the few lncRNAs hasbeen identified but several studies discussed the significant impact of lncRNAs in diabetic people which may represent the role of abnormal expression of lncRNAs in thelncRNAs in

effective biomarkers for data mining algorithms and have afeasible power to be applied for prediction of T2DM Also in this research we optimized the parameters of every algorithm and used stratified 10fold crossvalidation togain the best performance To be mentioned in the nearest neighbor�s algorithm theparameter k was varied between one and nine to find the bestoptimized method andwe selected k   to have the best performance and the lowest standard deviation in theaccuracy of the folds In addition in choosing the parameters of the artificial neuralnetwork the number of hidden layer neurons

SVM algorithm and Logistic regression which had the maximum accuracy in folds among others We should mention that the strong points ofour study are using demographic data and six Long noncoding RNAs and combiningthem to get the best detection power of T2DM and performing four outstanding datamining algorithms and comparing their performances As the limitations of this studywe should account for the limited number of samples which is due to the high costs ofmeasuring the Long noncoding RNAs No doubt the higher number of samples wouldlead to higher performance and more reliable resultsConclusionIn this paper the performance of conventional data mining classification techniqueshas been calculated and compared for a dataset of patients referred for the screeningof type  diabetes to the Shohada Hospital Iran The biomarker applied in this studydemonstrated high diagnostic value and the diagnostic process is suitable which couldhelp in the diagnosis of prediabetes and T2DMThe classification techniques compared were support vector machine artificial neuralnetwork decision tree nearest neighbors and logistic regression In data mining it isnot possible to say one classification technique will always work best and it often depends on the number of samples their distribution and the choosing of the right algorithm In this research work SVM and Logistic Regression had the best Area UnderCurve among methods of classification with the mean AUC of  KNN and ANNalso had the high mean AUC and small standard deviations of AUC scores among theapproaches KNN

cancer CRC is one of the leading cause ofdeath worldwide More than  million patients are diagnosed with CRC every year [�] What�s more this lifethreaten disease kills nearly  million people annually []In north America and Europe the morbidity and mortalityremain at high level [] despite developments of cancerscreening and endoscopy [ ] In China CRC becomesthe 5th most diagnosed cancer and 5th most deadly cancer[�] Nearly  million new cases are diagnosed andabout  million people die from the disease every year []Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is firstline treatment for CRC patients [ ] Capecitabine a carbamatederivative of fluoropyrimidine is the backbone of CRCchemotherapy [ ] Asthe oral prodrug of fluorouracil 5FU it is widely used for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy due to its long stable durationlower toxicity and convenient dosing compared to infusional 5FU [ ] However this chemotherapeutic drughas only modest efficacy the response rates of 5FU foradvanced CRC is only  for single treatment and for combined chemotherapy [ ] The chemoresistance is recognized as a principal obstacle for cancer therapy [�] leading to tumor recurrence or metastasisespecially liver and lung metastasis and cause over  ofCRC mortality [] Intense researches on the mechanisms underlying the resistance revealed that changes oftumor cells themselves cause resistance although thesefindings are mainly restricted to tumor specimen examinewhich is not that suitable for posttreatment surveillanceWhat�s more CT computed tomography scan and colonoscopy are insensitive to micro metastasis despite theirgoodrecurrenceCapecitabineresistant patients could only be diagnosedwith cancer recurrence by CT scan or colonoscopy about� years after capecitabine therapy [] when tumorsare big enough to be discovered Thus good prognosticmarkers are indispensable for predicting capecitabineresistance in the early stage after capecitabine therapydetection ofaccuracytheforCancer cells and their microenvironment could interactwith each other Immune cells could dynamically reflectcancer status and display multifaceted functions in cancerdevelopment [�] Myeloid cells including monocytesmacrophages granulocytes neutrophils eosinophils basophils and mast cells play critical roles in cancer progression [�] Myeloidderived suppressor cells MDSCs aheterogeneous population of myeloid cells remain at different stages of differentiation are immature counterparts ofmyeloid cells in cancer MDSCs acquire immunosuppressive features and mainly inhibit lymphocytes including Tcells and NK cells [�] Recent studies report that chemotherapeutic agents like 5FU could interact with myeloid cells and influence antitumor efficacy [�]Vincent J  reported that 5FU selectively inducedMDSC apoptotic cell death and increase IFN� productionby tumorspecific CD8T cells [] Other researchersshowed that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and increased amount of HSP70 exosomes on MDSC by 5FUlead to MDSC activation [ ] Yuan Y  found thattumorassociated macrophages secret IL6 to induce 5FUchemoresistance []ImportantlyIn this study we discovered that the expression ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells was dramatically decreased in capecitabineresistant CRC patients after capecitabine adjuvanttherapy The expression level ofCD16 was closely related to poor prognosis after capecitabine therapythe downregulation ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells appeared as early as month after capecitabine therapy in patients who werediagnosed with capecitabineresistance by CT scansabout � years after the treatment The cutoff value ofCD16 expression  would be helpful for the prediction of capecitabine chemoresistance Further analysisdemonstrated that these CD11bCD16low��myeloid cellswere mainly immature

therapy Importantlydownregulation of CD16 was observed as early as month after capecitabine treatment which was moresensitive than CT scan indicating its great value in clinical application We determined the cutoff value ofCD16 expression  on neutrophils for the prediction of capecitabine chemoresistance which would behelpful for clinical application and further

healthCapecitabine the oral form of 5FU which is widelyused in CRC therapy has only modest efficacy due tothe chemoresistance Great efforts have been taken tofind out the mechanism Previous studies mainly concentrated on tumor cells themselves such as expressionof specific genes or generation of particular tumor cells[ ] In this research we worked on the correlationbetween changes on immune system and capecitabinechemoresistance and illustrated the conversion fromneutrophilsto immunosuppressive PMNMDSClikeneutrophils in these capecitabine insensitive patients byRNA sequencing and flow cytometry Our conclusioncould also be supported by other studies that 5FUcould promote MDSC protumor function The study byBruchard M  found that 5FU could activate NLRP3inflammasome in MDSC and promote tumor growth[] Gobbo J  also discovered that 5FU facilitatedproduction of tumorderived HSP70 exosomes whichfavored MDSC activation [] Thus prevention ofMDSC function after capecitabine or 5FU therapyholds great promise for improving drug efficacyreceptorResearchers have revealed that CD16myeloid cellswere tightly related to CRC development[ ]Giulio S  found that CD16myeloid cell

CD8 T cells byTcelltriggering [] Our work differedfrom theirs in some ways Firstly our study focusedon CRC patients who received capecitabine adjuvanttreatment after surgery while Giulio Spagnoli groupfocused on all CRC patients and some healthy donorsSecondly biopsies from different positions were analyzed Peripheral blood was used in our study whileGiulio Spagnoli group mainly focused on tumor biopsies Exceptthese differences some of our resultswere also consistent with studies from Giulio Spagnoligroup Firstly both our data and Giulio Spagnoligroup�s data found that phenotype of peripheral bloodCD11bCD16myeloid cells had no difference betweenhealthy donors and CRC patients without capecitabinetherapy Fig S1F and G Secondly our work indicated that CD16 highpositive expression after capecitabine therapy predicted sensitivity to the therapyand good prognosis These results were consistentwith the work from Giulio Spagnoli groupthatCD16myeloid cells related to good prognosis of CRCpatientsMDSCs are a heterogeneous population of myeloidcells stay at different stages of differentiation PMNMDSCs are a great part of MDSCs that could be considered as counterparts of immature granulocytes chieflyimmature neutrophils []In this study we founddownregulation of CD16 expression on myeloid cells incapecitabineinsensitive CRC patients after capecitabinetreatment These CD16low��myeloid cells after the therapy were mainly immature neutrophils CD16 is a lowaffinity Fc� receptor which could activate antibodydependent process like phagocytosis in neutrophils andother phagocytes [] It is expressed on neutrophilsduring the maturation Researchers also revealed thatCD16 is typically associated with PMN activation andphagocytosis and its expression will change in differentmaturation status [ ] MDSCs could exert protumor roles mainly through inhibition of effective Tcells and NK cells [ ] Our study demonstrated thatlow expression of CD16 on neutrophils after the therapywas related to decreased frequencies of antitumor immune cells like CD8T cells and NK cells suggestingthatthey may have immunosuppressive activity asMDSCs The mechanism underlying the changes induced by capecitabine would be investigated further andit could be a good target to compete against capecitabinechemoresistanceConclusionsIn conclusion CD16 seems to be a promising target

[]According to the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology[] systemic opioids given to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery with general anesthesia activate opioidreceptors and stimulate various ans This often results in nausea and vomiting pruritus urinary retentionexcessive sedation and respiratory inhibition Thusinprinciple systemic opioids are not used for postoperativepain relief after day surgery The analgesic and adversereactions of mixed agonistantagonist opioids such asnalbuphine and dezocine also exhibit a ceiling effectImplementation of multimodal analgesia using NSAIDscan significantly reduce the dose of opioid and adversereactions and can be used postoperatively to managemoderate pain after ambulatory surgeryNalbuphine a mixed agonistantagonist opioid is associated with milder μ receptorrelated side effects Itsplasma halflife is  h and in clinical studies the durationof analgesic activity ranges from  to  h [] In ourstudy the VAS at rest of group E was less than  pointsand the difference was statistically significant comparedwith the VAS at rest before administration This indicates that nalbuphine could effectively relieve pain afterambulatory surgery Similar results were also observedin animal studies that showed amelioration of somaticand visceral pain in mice after treatment with nalbuphine []In the present study the VAS at rest at timepoints T1to T4 of the nalbuphine group group E did not differfrom that of the control At T5 the VAS at rest of thenalbuphine group was significantly lower than that ofthe tramadol group This indicates that the duration

satisfaction with analgesia [ ]In the present study the difference in respiratoryrates before and after administration in both the nalbuphine and tramadol groups was not statistically significant and no respiratory depression was observedMany studies have reported that respiratory depression caused by nalbuphine is small and has a ceilingeffect [ ] In one study a neonate was wronglyadministered a tenfold higher dose than required ofnalbuphine and it resulted in only prolonged sedationwith no respiratory failure []studyIn the presentStudies have shown that preanesthetic injections ofnalbuphine could reduce stress responses and fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate during intubation [ ]the bloodpressures and heart rates of both groups after administration were significantly lower than at T1 althoughstill within normal ranges The blood pressure at T0Inception of the study was compared to the bloodpressure after surgery T1T5 the blood pressure atT1 was significantly higher than at T0 However atthe later timepoints T2 to T5 there were no statistical differences in the blood pressures compared toT0 The decrease in blood pressure after administration T2T5 may have been due to the alleviation ofpain If sothen the lowered blood pressure couldalso indicate the analgesic efficacy of nalbuphineThere are several limitations in this study First a limited number of parameters VAS score adverse eventsand change of vital signs were observed within the halflife of the medication Secondly the VAS scores were recorded at rest and not during movement Finally due toethical issues a placebo control group was not possibleTherefore we were not able to assess the effectiveness ofnalbuphine or tramadol at  and  h after administration Fortunately none of the patients dropped out during the  or  h after administration of medication forpain However the present results warrant further experiments to determine comprehensively the effectiveness and safety of nalbuphine for the treatment of painafter ambulatory surgeryConclusionThis study indicates that nalbuphine at a recommendeddose of  mgkg is safe and effective for pain management after ambulatory

SIBO can be an overlookedcause of poor wound healing during the treatment ofpressure soresSIBO was first reported by Vantrappen  as an increased concentration of 14CO2 in a bile acid breath testfor patients with an absent interdigestive motor complex[] Today consensus diagnostic criteria for SIBO arethe presence of more than  �  CFUmL of bacteriaor any amount of E coli in the proximal small bowelcontent [] Relatively little is known about commensalsinhabiting the small intestine mainly due to the limitedaccessibility of this environment for microbiological analysis [] In the healthy state the numbers of intestinalbacteria range from  to  CFUmL and mainly include gramnegative and grampositive aerobes such asStreptococcus Lactobacillus and Bacteroidesspecies[] Regarding the amount of bacteria in proximal jejunal aspiration Khoshini  report that normal subexceed  �  CFUmL and thereforejectsproposed more than  �  CFUmL coliform bacteriaas the threshold for SIBO [] In our case  CFUmLE coli existed in duodenal content and  CFUmL Ecoli existed in gastric content which met the traditionaldiagnostic criteria of SIBOrarelyOther diagnostic methods for SIBO are breath testsusing hydrogen or hydrogen methane with lactulose lucose [] Breath tests have clinical utility for diagnosing SIBO because they are less invasive than obtaining proximal small bowel content However there areno standardized criteria for diagnosing SIBO usingbreath tests [] We did not perform a breath test inour case studyDespite no previous reports of an association betweenunhealed pressure sores and SIBO nutritional status isknown to be important for the healing of pressure sores []In our case the sacral pressure sore which was initially refractory began to heal after starting treatment for

SIBO in our case as well as decreased physical activity due to fracture ofthe lefthumerus and bilateral tibiaChronic gastrointestinalinvolvement is seen in � of patients with SCI [  ] SCI patients lackcentral nervous system control over the gastrointestinalsystem [] Liu  report that bowel problems in SCIpatients are related to high levels of cord injury completeness of cord injury and postinjury durations of years or more [] Moderate or severe grade depressivestatus is also associated with neurologic bowel dysfunction in SCI patients Of these risk factors our patienthad complete cord injury that had occurred more than years ago Also many bowel symptoms appear in patients with SCI eg constipation distension incontinence abdominal pain bowel accidents nausea diarrheastrainingautonomichyperreflexia headaches or sweat relieved by a bowelmovement [  �] However our patient showedno appetite loss a sufficient amount of food intake andnonsevere bowel symptoms Thus the presence of malnutrition despite adequate food intake and low levels oflipidsoluble vitamins that were unresponsive to supplementation led us to suspect SIBOrectal bleeding hemorrhoidsAlthough gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SCI there are few reports ofSIBO in SCI patients Cheng  report that  of  of SCI patients were diagnosed with SIBO basedon the glucose hydrogenmethane breath test [] However the prevalence of SIBO among SCI patients as confirmed by the consensus diagnostic criteria ofthepresence of more than  CFUmL bacteria or anyamount of E coli in upper digestive tract content is unknown In patients with SCI absent central nervous system innervation of the digestive tract can change theinhabiting environment of bacteria Gungor  reportdifferences in gut microbial patterns between SCI patients and control individuals as measured by bacterialgenome sequencing [] Specifically they found thatbutyrateproducing bacteria were specifically reduced inSCI patients Thus it is possible that SIBO is overlookedin patients with SCI In our caseit is unclear whenSIBO occurred relative to the time of SCI but we suspect that it arose due to gastrointestinal motility disorder caused by autonomic disturbancesDisturbances in fat absorption and deficiency in fatsoluble vitamins ie vitamins A K E and D3 areobserved in patients with SIBO [] Excess bacteria inthe small intestine promotes a change from conjugatedbile acid into deconjugated bile acid which decreasesthe micellar solubilization of dietary fat Bacterial fermented short chain fatty acid causes osmotic watermovement to the intestinal lumen which results in diarrhea and malabsorption [] Intestinal epithelial damagein SIBO also interferes with fat absorption Mucosaldamage is caused by metabolites of aerobic bacteria endotoxins of anaerobic bacteria and lithocholic acidwhich is a bacterial degradation product of unconjugatedbile acid [�] Our patient however showed constipation rather than diarrhea in spite of SIBO Whether ornot diarrhea occurs in patients with SIBO is determinedby multiple factors Constipation frequently occurs inpatients with SCI due to decreased physical activity andautonomic dysfunction De Looze  reported that therate of constipation in the patients with SCI is  []A certain proportion of the patients with SCI show constipation in spite of the coexisting SIBO Cheng  reported that in patients with both SCI and SIBO showed constipation [] We believe that the factorsleading to constipation in our patient were stronger thanthose leading to diarrhea Vitamin D deficiency in SIBOcauses osteomalacia Our patientshowed multiplefractures and osteoporosis with serum vitamin D3 levelsbelow thetosupplementationrefractorydetectionlimitandThere is no consensus on the choice dose or durationof antibiotics for treating SIBO [] In principle antibiotics should be chosen based on the results of an antimicrobial susceptibility test but this approach cannotaddress the great diversity in microbiota of the digestivetract [ ] Metronidazole is a firstline choice forSIBO [] with other choices being rifaximin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin amoxicillinclavulanate trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole cephalexin or their combination []However these antibodies are selected based on customrather than scientific evidence [] In our case we usedoral polymyxin B and amphotericin B in accordancewith SDD which was first reported as a method of preventing ventilationassociated pneumonia and microbialtranslocation of gramnegative rod bacteria and fungi incritically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit[�] Polymyxin B administered to the digestive tractis nonabsorbent into the human body and has strongbactericidal power against gramnegative rod bacteriaexcept for naturally polymyxinresistant bacteria such asProteus Providencia Manella Burkholderia and Serratia [] Amphoteric B is an antifungal drug that isalso nonabsorbent into the human body when administered to the digestive tract In our case after startingSDD fatsoluble vitamins were increased and osteoporosis was improved No obvious adverse effects of SDD 0cKubota  BMC Gastroenterology            Page  of such as antibioticassociated diarrhea were observed inour caseWhen and how to stop antibiotherapy for the treatment of patients with SIBO are difficult problemsFew reports are available for the method and timingfor making a decision to stop antibiotherapy in SIBOLauritano  reported that the recurrence rate at months after stopping antibiotherapy in SIBO patientsis  [] They also showed that an older age history of appendectomy and chronic use of PPIs areassociated with SIBO recurrence Bures  reportedthat cyclical gastrointestinal selective antibiotics areneeded for SIBO treatment [] These reports indicatethat in many patients with SIBO it is actually impossible to stop antibiotherapy because of the underlyingconditions that lead to SIBO Similarly in our case itwas difficult to ameliorate the underlying condition ofdecreased motility of the digestive tract due to SCIWe were compelled to continue SDD for a long duration We did however succeed in gradually reducingthe dose of polymyxin B and end the use of amphotericin B without signs of SIBO recurrence Withcareful consideration it may be possible and feasibleto stop SDD completelyProbiotics are also a treatment approach for SIBO assome species of bacteria are thought to protect againsthigh numbers of E coli and fungi in the digestive tract[] However the role and effects of probiotics are stillunclear The digestive tract microbiome has both pathogenic potential and a protective role in maintaininghealth However metagenomic analysis reveals that � of microanisms in the digestive tract cannot becultured under laboratory conditions [] The effects ofSDD and probiotics on the digestive tract microbiome inpatients with SIBO should be investigated to furtherunderstand the pathogenesis of the diseaseIn conclusion we treated a patient with a sacral pressure sore who also had SCI multiple fractures withosteoporosis and malabsorption especially of fatsolublevitamins Based on culture of upper digestive tract content we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and startedSDD using polymyxin B and amphotericin B which effectively ameliorated the absorbency disturbance andallowed healing of the pressure sore In light of severalcommon risk factors between pressure sores and SIBOsuch as decreased physical activity our case providesadditional

completely reliable and wesuggest that researchers may require multiplemeasures selfreport and medicationbased measures of morbidity to fully capture accurate prevalence estimates of multimorbidity Our study identified several limitations of thecurrent versions of the RxRisk indices which require updating if medicationbased measures ofmorbidity are to be used to assess the epidemiologyof chronic conditions and multimorbiditytheofIndeedattentionBackgroundMultimorbidity is commonly defined as the presence oftwo or more chronic medical conditions and its prevalence has been shown to increase with age [] As theworld�s older population continues to grow multimorbidity has become an important public health issue caphealthcareturingresearchersprofessionals as well as policy makersforhealthcare systems to effectively adapt and manage thedelivery of healthcare to our growing older populationan accurate description of the epidemiology of chronicconditions is required However to date studies in theliterature reveal wide disparities in prevalence estimatesof multimorbidity ranging from  to  [ ] Thislarge variability is thought to be due to the lack of standards defining multimorbidity and validated methods forhow it should be measured [] A recent systematic review reported  definitions of multimorbidity involving  differenttheappropriateness of different measures of multimorbidityis also variable depending on both the outcome of interest as well as the type of data that is available []In additioncriteria[]Measures of multimorbidity include diagnosisbasedmeasures eg Charlson Index based on hospital diagnosis codes ICD codes [] medicationbased measureseg RxRisk and RxRiskV for those aged �� yearsbased on pharmacy data [] and patient selfreportDiagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity are themost common measures and are generally based on hospital or physician records [] Medicationbased measures of multimorbidity include the RxRisk and RxRiskV � two algorithms which determine an individual�scurrent comorbidities based on their dispensed medication The RxRisk indexes only include morbidities forwhich a medicine could be prescribed and include categories of morbidities based on the World Health anisation WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Classification ATC system [�] The RxRisk and RxRiskVhave good reliability and criterion validity against ICD9diagnoses and have been shown to predict costs of caremortality and health care utilisation [] Previous studies have reported medicationbased measures of morbidity such as the Medicines Disease Burden Index MDBIand RxRiskV to be useful in epidemiological studieswhen adjusting for comorbidity [] However there arefew studies describing the use of these indices to directlymeasure chronic conditions Patient selfreport is also avalid method of identifying disease categories A study ofolder patients with multimorbidity reported good agreement between patient selfreport and general practitioner GP report for a wide range of diseases []A number of studies have compared the differentmeasures of multimorbidity with differing results [ ] A study of older primary care patients inIreland found that medicationbased measures ofmultimorbidity such as RxRiskV performed betterthan diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity inpredicting emergency and ambulatory care sensitiveACS admissions [] Studies comparing patientselfreport and diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity have reported a stronger association between selfreport measures of multimorbidity andqualitythandiagnosisbased measures [ ] However no previous research has compared selfreported morbidityin the primary care or community setting with theRxRisk measures of morbidity Comparison betweenselfreported morbidity data and pharmacy records isimportant in order to understand the relative meritsof each measure of morbidity and the potential formisclassification particularly in the community setting where access to medical or clinical data can belimitedfunctionaloutcomesandlifeofStudies have also indicated that agreement betweenselfreport measures and other measures of morbiditymight be influenced by patient recall bias [] Patientrecall has been reported to be influenced by age maritalstatus and education [] There is also some evidencethat cognition and memory influence patient recall []The impact of these factors needs to be explored furtherwhen assessing and comparing measures of morbidityThe aim of this study was to  compare the agreementbetween patient selfreported morbidity and medicationbased morbidity RxRisk and RxRiskV and  examine potential patientlevel predictors of discordance between theincludingdemographic cognitive and mental

This growing epidemic effects notonly the individuals living with dementia but also theirfamilies caring for them the communities they live in andthe health care systems they rely uponFamily or friends are often key informal caregivers forpeople living with dementia [ ] Globally over billion hours ofinformal care is provided to peopleliving with dementia [ ] Whilst providing this carecan be highly rewarding it has also been described as achronic stressor with caregivers reporting low qualityand quantity of sleep [] and high levels of stress anddepression [] In fact sleep disruption is prevalentamongst dementia caregivers with over  of caregiversexperiencing sleep disturbances []The National Sleep Foundation recommend that olderadults �� years require seven to  h sleep for optimalphysical and psychological wellbeing [] Yet numerousstudies have illustrated that dementia caregivers sleepsignificantly less than that with estimates reporting mostcaregivers sleep less than  h per night [] Not only arecaregivers sleeping less than they should the sleep theydo get is of significantly lower quality than their noncaregiver counterparts []Poor sleep is associated with a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes including hypertensionobesity mood disorders and dementia [] A disruptedsleep pattern is also recognised as a significant factor inpredicting caregiver strain [ ] and perhaps more importantly in predicting placing an individual into long termcare [] Enabling people living with dementia to stay athome rather than transfer to longterm care is the optimaloutcome for many families However this cannot be to thedetriment of the caregiver�s own physical andor psychological wellbeing Therefore in order to support the personliving with dementia

withdementia reported poor sleep quality and high levels ofdepression anxiety and stress This study found that poorsleep was correlated with subjective feelings of depressionanxiety and stress which were in keeping with previousliterature around caregiving and psychological distressMore than half of the caregivers surveyed reported symptoms of depression and stress  and  respectivelyand  reported anxiety These findings are in keepingwith that of a recent study of dementia caregivers in ruralVictoria where  of caregivers reported depression orstress and  reported anxiety []Previous work has identified an association betweendepression and poor sleep among dementia caregivers[ ] Reduced quality of sleep and depression arehigher among caregivers of people living with dementia[] Furthermore caregivers of people living withdementia who were also depressed experience a greatervariation in sleep patterns []This study reveals sleep scores were significantly associated with measures of

Further exploration of predictive factors incaregiverssleep quality identified stress as a keypredictor of poor overall sleep quality whilst adjustingfor age gender comorbidities and length of care This isa novel finding and represents a potential therapeutictarget to improve sleep quality in dementia caregiversDespite the high prevalence of selfidentified poorsleep overnight respite was only used by  of participants which is in keeping with previous research thatcites  of Australian caregivers have never usedrespite services [] Access to respite care remains oneof the major means of easing caregiver burden and is 0cSmyth  BMC Geriatrics            Page  of frequently identified as needed by caregivers yet remainsunderutilised Whilst a high proportion of dementiacaregivers report

Respite services have been cited asan important measure to allow caregivers time to attend totheir own health imperative to supporting the caregiver tocontinue in providing care for their loved one []A recent Australian parliamentary inquiry into sleephealth identified sleep as a foundation of positive healthand wellbeing alongside diet and exercise [] Furthermore the report urged government to prioritise sleephealth as a national priority given its pivotal role inmaintaining health It is clear that caregivers of PLWDhave suboptimal sleep which is associated with poorerpsychological wellbeing and potential increased risk ofdeveloping chronic health conditions such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease [] Interestingly cardiovascular disease and endocrine disease such as diabeteswere the most prevalent comorbidities in our studypopulation Previous studies have also identified highblood pressure diabetes and arthritis as the most prevalent chronic disease in the dementia caregiver groupwhich is in keeping with our findings []Managing sleep and its associated mediators will havedirect impact on both the caregiver�s own health as wellas the caregiver care recipient relationship It is imperative to provide educational support around sleep considerpractical interventions such as overnight respite and toaddress stress management interventions for caregivers inturn reinstating and preserving sleep of this critical population of informal caregiversLimitationsA limitation of this study was the small sample size despitenumerous attempts to recruit participants and involvementof national anisations Although over  participantsprovided demographic details only  participants completed all questionnaires and were included in statisticalanalyses Challenges related to recruiting caregivers andparticularly caregivers of people living with dementia hasbeen described in numerous publications [   ]Caregivers of people with dementia living in the community are more likely to be female and this was representedin our population Furthermore caregivers who are underthe greatest stress may also be those least likely to participate However this remains one of the larger studies ofAustralian dementia caregivers sleep Another limitationwithin this study was that no data was collected regardingthe severity of dementia or behavioural disturbances whichmay impact sleep of the caregiverConclusionSleep problems are widespread within the population ofdementia caregivers Given that the majority of peopleliving with dementia are reliant on family caregiversminimising health and psychologicalimpact on caregivers should be of major concern Furthermore sleepquality is correlated with emotional distress in dementiacaregivers so improving the sleep of caregivers may inturn improve their psychological wellbeing Converselystress is a significant predictor of poor sleep so managing stress may have a positive impact on sleepDementia caregivers are often older with coexistingmorbidities and high levels of psychological distress Withprolonged caregiving and the progression of dementia ofthe care recipient there is the potential for a concurrent decline in the caregivers mental and physical health In orderto support the caregiver in their role it is of the upmost importance that we promote and maximises their health andwellbeing By managing and minimising the negative factorsassociated with caregiving we can enhance caregiving satisfaction and gratification In turn this can ensure optimalcaregivercare recipient relationship

rate in the elderly population [] Glioma accounts for approximately  of allcentral nervous system CNS tumors and  of malignant primary brain tumors [] According to the World Health anization WHO classification of tumors ofthe CNS gliomas were classified into fourgrades WHO grade I to IV based on histologic criteria[] WHO grades I and II gliomas are recognized as lowgrade gliomas LGG and grades III and IV are considered highgrade gliomas HGG [] In particular glioblastoma GBM WHO grade IV is the most commonmalignant tumor of the CNS accounting for  ofprimary malignant the CNS tumors and  of all gliomas [] The median survival of GBM patients is approximately  months even after receiving multimodaltherapies that include maximal surgical resection withthe preservation of neurological functions followed byadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy []Gliomas can occur at any age with various incidencesat different ages as reported in populationbased studies[  ] LGG is the most common brain tumor in children while HGG is the most frequent brain tumor inadults [] Tumors in the supratentorial areas of thebrain cerebral hemispheres and midline structuresabove the tentorium were most frequent in adults whilesubtentorial brainstem and cerebellum tumors weremore common in young children than in adolescentsand adults [] Besides increasing studies have assessedage a prognostic factor There are differences in prognosis among patients of different ages even with the samediagnosis A singlecenter review of  patients withintracranial anaplastic oligodendroglioma showed thatthe median survival time of patients younger than years old was significantly longer than that of patientsolder than  years old [] Other studies have shownthat age was an important prognostic factor in additionto KPS score surgical scope and histology [ ]Therefore for patients diagnosed with glioma by imaging examination and auxiliary examination it is necessary to consider the age of the patients to performpersonalized treatment for better outcomesHowever there is no uniform age criterion for groupingglioma patients for personalized treatment [] Some glioma patient cohorts were divided into different age groupsaccording to fixed age intervals [] some were dividedinto two groups based on a certain age point [] andothers were divided based on the overall survival OS ofthe patients [] Different criteria for age grouping haveled to inconsistent s regarding the prognosticvalue of age Some studies showed that age was not aprognostic factor in patients with glioma [ ] whileanother populationbased glioblastoma study with five agegroups   years � years � years � yearsand   years showed that the OS of young patients  years was significantly longer than that for elderly patients   years median  months vs  months p  [] Agerelated studies involving a large numberof glioma patients have yielded some relevant results [] but the age grouping criteria for these studies are influenced by several clinical factors such as the tendencyof clinical researchers Therefore there is an urgent needto establish a more appropriate age group classificationcriterion for better management of glioma patientsFor this purpose we conducted a retrospective studycollecting clinical data from  patients with histologically proven gliomas in Nanfang Hospital between and  Based on this cohort we established a methodof age group classification according to WHO grade forrisk stratification in glioma patients and investigated thecharacteristics of different age groups in terms of genderWHO grade pathological subtype tumor cell differentiation tumor size tumor location and pathological molecular markersMethodsData collectionA total of  patients diagnosed with gliomas

and elderly patients and the various prognoses of patients of different groups even with the samediagnosis only two age groups for the classification ofglioma patients were not sufficient in clinical practiceTherefore these two groups were subdivided into fourgroups First dummy variables were created by agegroups of 0I years old and I47 years old I any age between  and  The established dummy variables wereconsidered as independent variables and a logistic regression model was set up according to whether gliomapatients were high grade glioma or WHO IV grade glioma The AIC value for each model was calculated Themodel with the smallest AIC value was regarded as thebest model According to whether the patient sufferedfrom WHO IV glioma the diagnostic age classificationcriteria were � years old pediatric group and �years old young group According to whether the patient was suffered from highgrade glioma the diagnosticage classification criteria were � years old pediatricgroup and � years old young group The evidencesuggeststhe difference between the biologicalspectrum of the disease may be reflected in the diagnostic age with the majority of the pediatric group belonging to the category described by Paugh et al[]Although some of the molecular abnormalities encountered in HGG in children are reminiscent of secondaryglioblastomas these tumors rarely originate from existing

heterogeneity across the four agegroups Supplementary Figure S4 S5 S6 S7 S8 S9S10 S11 Supplementary Table S4S5DiscussionClinical and biological data clearly indicate thatthecharacteristics and outcomes of malignant gliomas differsignificantly between adults and children [] A numberof studies have showed that the tumorprone locationshistopathology prognosis and some molecular markersare different in glioma patients of different ages [ ]Growing research has shown that the molecular characteristics of GBM in elderly patients are more aggressivethan those in young patients [] Childhood

prognosis of glioma is particularly severe in older adults [ ] The clinical practicepatterns show that with increasing age the applicationof surgical resection radiotherapy and chemotherapy decreases [�] Nevertheless some elderly patients withglioblastoma can benefitfrom these therapies []These elderly patients will receive aggressive treatmentwith radiation or chemotherapy When consideringtreatment options for children with gliomas neurosurgeons will try to avoid the deleterious effects of radiotherapy on the developing brains of children Minimaldysfunction resulting from glioma and treatment shouldbe achieved as much as possible with the expectation ofchildren living to adulthood [] Moreover age isregarded as an important factor related to the prognosisof glioma patients Thereforefor patients diagnosedwith glioma age should be taken into consideration toperform personalized treatment for a better outcomeHowever the criterion for appropriately dividing agegroups of glioma patients remains an unresolved clinicalproblemA large number of studies used different age groupings and these studies led us to differential sabout the prognosis value of age in glioma patients [ ] These contradictory s could be partlyexplained by the difference in age classification criteriabetween different studies In one study a multivariateCox regression model with different cutoff points wasused to analyze the effect of age on OS but only threeage groups were compared and univariate analysis wasperformed using prognostic factors as a classification criterion [] OS is a good indicator for evaluating patientoutcomes but confounding factors such as tumor sizetumor location surgical resection extent and patientcompliance might impair the accuracy of the relationship between age and OSTo avoid the disturbance of confounding factors asmuch as possible our study used the WHO grade of glioma as a dependent variable to assess the prognosis ofglioma patients The classification criteria for glioma patients based on age were � years old pediatric groupand � years old youth group � years oldmiddleaged group and ��  years old elderly groupThis age group classification can be used for preliminaryevaluation of newlydiagnosed glioma patients and helpsto perform precise management in clinical practice according to age group Besides we found that EGFRpositive expression was more common in the middleage group and the EGFR expression in IDH1mut gliomas was more apparent Therefore patients withIDH1mut glioma aged � years old might benefitfrom EGFR inhibitor therapy Based on this age groupclassification we further analyzed the characteristics ofWHO grade tumor size tumor histology and anatomical location among the four age groups We found thatthe proportion of WHO grade IV gliomas and positiveexpression of Ki67 Oligo2 and IDHwt increased significantly in elderly age groups In addition in the olderage group more patients suffered from a heavy tumorburden tumor size   cm Regarding the histology ofglioma pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common inchildren while glioblastoma accounts for the largest proportion of adult groups Many studies have demonstrated that patients with a higher grade of glioma havea worse outcome [] Moreover a larger tumor burdenmight cause a higher risk of functional deficits includingmotor dysfunction impaired communication ability ordecline in neurocognitive function [] Therefore theprognosis of patients with gliomas can initially be evaluated according to age On the other hand patientsgrouping according to age has been widely used in clinical studies but there is no uniform standard of agegroup classification for patients with glioma The agegroup established on the basis of objective pathologicaldiagnosis in this study will be helpful for clinical trialsdesign in the futureGlioma especially glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy In addition to the marked heterogeneity of tumor size and histopathology the heterogeneityof the molecular characteristics of tumors is becomingincreasingly important and is reported in several studiesAccording to the  WHO classification glioma isfirst classified according to histologicalfeatures andthen more subtypes are classified according to molecularcharacteristics There are a variety of indicators that arewidely used in clinical practice such as GFAP EMAMGMT P53 NeuN Oligo2 EGFR VEGF IDH1 Ki671p19q and these indicators are highly correlated withthe prognosis of the patients [�] Agedependentoccurrence and the effects of different biological markershave been reported in malignancies [] For examplethe association between age and tumor grade Ki67markers apoptosis index EGFR expression and erbB2expression has been reported in breast cancer [] Astudy indicated that the prognostic effects of P53 1pand CDKN2Ap16 alterations are dependent on patientage [] Increasing translational studies have significantly advanced the understanding of glioma pathogenesis and have identified several prognostic factorsHigher tumor grade older age [] and increased expression of molecular biomarkers such as P53 []MGMT [] PR []

observational studies orclinical trials [  ] In a large randomized controltrial RCT based on  Iranian women the intervention of 25OHD3 was associated with lower risk ofGDM [] The results were further

detrimental influence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in the reference group [] Increasing benefitsmight not exist for higher doses Second the vitamin Dreceptor is important for the utilization of vitamin D[ ] The difference in vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism might help explain the ethnic heterogeneity[] This requires further confirmation in the futureThird the studies were conducted during different trimesters of gestation which might increase the difficultyof making comparisons those studies conducted duringan early gestational period might be advantageous forcausal inference and early preventionBecause 25OHD3 contributes most to the 25OHDconcentrations it has been used to represent 25OHDin many studies and only a few studies have focused on25OHD2 In our study the results were generally consistent between these two subcomponents The associations tend to be more pronounced in 25OHD2 than in25OHD3 and mightindicate the prominence of25OHD2 over 25OHD3 for the prevention of relateddiseases This theory merits further confirmation Nevertheless our results and others provide further evidencefor the importance of a better early vitamin D status forthe prevention of GDM cesarean section preterm birthand low birth weight in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency Our results indicated thatmore consideration should be given to distinguishing between the vitamin D subcomponents women pregnantat different ages and women with more pregnancy complications in this field Considering the high prevalenceof vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy observed inChina [ ] it is a matter of urgency to call for the supplementation of vitamin D and more efforts should bemade to improve the gestational vitamin D status ofChinese populationVitamin D deficiency was found to decrease vasculardiameter within the labyrinth region and dysregulateplacental development during early pregnancy in an animal experiment [] Vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy might rescue this situation while furthersupplementation might be futile after missing this timepoint [] Moreover vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy is likely to affect genetic information ofsystemic inflammation and immune responses involvedin the development of gestational comorbidities egGDM preeclampsia and infection as reviewed by Hollis [] These mechanisms help to explain the beneficialinfluences of vitamin D for maternal and infanthealth and emphasize the importance of improving vitamin D status during early pregnancyOurstudy had several advantages Firstserum25OHD concentrations were measured during an earlygestational period and with the retrospective cohort design we assured the temporal sequence and avoided thepossibility of causal inversion Second we studied multiple outcomes and conducted further analysis of thesubcomponent of vitamin D and a stratified analysis ofgestational age which provided a more comprehensiveunderstanding of this field There are also several limitations of our study First our study was limited by thelack of information on dietary vitamin D intake including by supplement and sunlight exposure during thepregnancy period The obtained data were difficult touse for a retrospective study while the use of blood indicators might be more precise than a dietary survey sowe adjusted the association for different seasons to attenuate their influence Second the 25OHD concentration was measured only once we could not monitor thedynamic changes afterward or determine whether theywere normalized after receiving vitamin D supplementation However the associations tended to be underestimated instead of overestimated Third Wagner et al[] and Mirzakhani  [] indicated a 25OHDconcentration ��  nmolL in early pregnancy was optimal for the prevention of preterm birth and preeclampsia however the highest 25OHD concentration in ourstudy is only  nmolL Therefore we were unable toperform the analyses using a threshold of  nmolLand assess the influences of higher 25OHD concentrations Finally residual confounding might still existthough we tried to control several potential covariatesConclusionsThis retrospective cohort study showed the beneficial associations of early gestational vitamin D with outcomesof GDM cesarean section preterm birth and low birthweight

occurred tumor amongmen in the United States [] The biggest challenge isthe detectable bone metastases in roughly  advancedprostate cancer [] Virtually all prostate cancer patientsduring  years� androgen deprivation treatment inevitably undergo castrationresistance which contributes tothe poor clinical consequences in prostate cancer []However the mechanism underlaid prostate cancer remains mostly unknownThe widely studied long noncoding RNAs lncRNAsare transcribed from nonproteincoding human genomeand have more than  nt in length [] LncRNAs are increasingly functionally identified and experimentally consolidated to be related to tumor neoplasia and progressionin diverse cancers [] Additionally lncRNAs with dysregulation can functionally modulate tumor developmentfrom multiple pathological aspects such as cell proliferation drugresistance and metastasis [�] For examplelncRNA A1BGAS1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasionin hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting miR216a5p []LncRNA LOC730100 sponges miR760 from FOXA1 toaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion in glioma []LncRNA SNHG16 functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [] Long intergenic nonprotein codingRNA  LINC00992 is a novel lncRNA that has beenpreviously revealed to be elevated in tumors and substantiated as a master regulator for chemoresistance [] Besides LINC00992 has been uncovered as an elevatedlncRNA in prostate cancer [] which is consistent withthe detection from GEPIA database Despite that no previous study has given a comprehensive explanation aboutthe precise function or detailed mechanism of LINC00992in prostate cancerIn past decades the fact that lncRNAs function in tumors depending on their secondary or tertiary structureshas been reported in many cancerlinked studies For instance in the nucleus lncRNAs are entitled to work asmolecular scaffolds or alternative splicing assistants [] On the contrary lncRNAs dispersing in cytoplasm influence downstream mRNA translation or degradationthrough serving as miRNA sponges [ ] For exampleTNFαinduced lncRNA LOC105374902 promotes themalignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells by acting as asponge of miR12853p [] LncRNA TTNAS1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer tumorigenesis by regulatingmiR1533pZNRF2 axis[] Nevertheless whetherLINC00992 could exert its functions in prostate cancer viaits sponging role of certain miRNA remains unknownWe conducted this research aiming to explore thefunction or probable mechanism of LINC00992 in prostate tumor which might enrich the understanding interms of prostate tumor pathology and contribute to awider applied scopeMethodsTissue samplesThe prostate cancer tissue samples and matched peritumor tissue samples were collected from  patientsdiagnosed with prostate

prostate cancer cells and RWPE1 cells was evaluated by qRTPCRConsequently higher level of LINC00992 was exhibitedin prostate cancer cells than that in RWPE1 cells Fig1b which was completely consistent

were presented in Supplementary figure  P   p  transfected into DU145 and PC3 cells and the efficiencywas corroborated in qRTPCR Fig 1c And then thedata from CCK8 assay revealed that LINC00992 depletion suppressed the proliferation of DU145 and PC3cells Fig 1d As expected a declined proportion ofEdU positive cells was observed after knocking downLINC00992 Fig 1e suggesting the suppressive effect ofLINC00992 deficiency on prostate cancer cell proliferation Additionally the expression levels of proliferationrelated proteins PCNA CDK2 and Cyclin D1 were allreduced by silenced LINC00992 Figure S1C On thecontrary TUNEL assay uncovered that LINC00992knockdown facilitated cell apoptosis Fig 1f Meanwhile western blot analysis revealed that LINC00992knockdown promoted the apoptosis of DU145 and PC3cells as Bax protein level was increased whereas Bcl2protein level was decreased after LINC00992 was silenced in these two cells Figs 1g Figure S1D FurtherTranswell and wound healing

LINC00992 located mainlyin cytoplasm Fig 2a Likewise FISH assay and RNAisolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions furtherverified the abundance of LINC00992 in the cytoplasmof prostate cancer cells Fig 2bc highlighting a posttranscriptional control of LINC00992 in such cellsHence we speculated that LINC00992 might act as aceRNA in prostate cancer regulation According toDIANAlncBase the top three potential miRNAs possessing the binding capacity with LINC00992 were listedFig 2d To targetthe highlymatched miRNA toLINC00992 qRTPCR analysis was conducted to testthe expression changes of these miRNAs following eitherLINC00992 depletion or augmentation The resultsdemonstrated that only miR3935 expression was increased by LINC00992 depletion Fig 2e but reducedby LINC00992 overexpression in the meantime Fig 2fThus miR3935 was chosen for further analysis Afterwards RNA pull down assay was implemented and theresult depicted that LINC00992 was pulled down byBiomiR3935WT Fig 2g which indicated the bindingof LINC00992 and miR3935 Later we observed thesatisfactory efficiency of miR3935 overexpression andmiR3935 inhibition through qRTPCR analysis Fig2h Thereafter RIP assay applying antiAgo2 was executed Results illustrated that LINC00992 and miR3935were highly enriched in antiAgo2 group in comparisonwith control antibody Fig 2i certifying the associationof LINC00992 with miR3935 in the RNAinduced silencing complexes RISCs To further explore the interaction between LINC00992 and miR3935 the bindingsites between LINC00992 and miR3935 were predictedat first and then data from luciferase reporter assayrevealed that miR3935 upregulation decreased theluciferase activity of LINC00992WT reporter whereasmiR3935 inhibition increased the luciferase activity ofLINC00992WT reporter Fig 2j Altogether LINC0 combined with miR3935 to act as a miRNA decoyin prostate cancerLINC00992 regulates the expression of GOLM1 a targetof miR3935Present evidence has suggested that miRNAs can bindwith downstream target genes to inhibit their expressionHerein we searched the miR3935 target genes andeight mRNAs were found out Subsequently we detectedtheir expression in prostate cancer cells and normalcells Interestingly we found that only Golgi membraneprotein  GOLM1 was highly expressed in four prostate cancer cell lines relative to normal controls Fig 3aFurther we discovered that GOLM1 expression wasmarkedly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues according to data from GEPIA database Fig 3b SimilarlyGOLM1 expression was much higher in prostate cancertissue samples than in peritumor samples Figure S3AIn addition the mRNA and protein levels of GOLM1were overexpressed in prostate cancer cells in contrastto RWPE1 cells Fig 3c Figure S3B Besides GOLM1has been previously revealed as a prostate cancer facilitator and was metastasisrelated in prostate tumor [�] Thus we hypothesized that GOLM1 might act asthe downstream of LINC00992miR3935 signaling inprostate cancer Through TargetScan httpwwwtargetscanvert_72 the binding site between GOLM1and miR3935 was predicted Fig 3d After conductingluciferase reporter assay in DU145 and PC3 cells weobserved that upregulation of miR3935 specifically decreased the luciferase activity of GOLM1WT reporterFig 3e confirming the interaction between miR3935and GOLM1 relied on the putative binding sites Thenwe unveiled that GOLM1 mRNA and protein levels wereboth reduced by LINC00992 inhibition or miR3935upregulation according to qRTPCR and western blotanalyses Fig 3fg Figure S3C Moreover data fromRIP assay unveiled the binding of miR3935 to GOLM1in the RISCs Fig 3h Further we demonstrated thatthe decreased mRNA and protein levels of GOLM1 induced by LINC00992 depletion could be restored afterinhibiting miR3935 expression

circRNAs serve asprognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in osteosarcomapatients and the relative potential mechanism mainly attributes to the regulation of downstream signaling pathwaysby sponging microRNA In addition lncRNA [] microRNA [] and many clinical data [] were also identified asprognostic biomarkers for osteosarcoma patients However osteosarcoma is one of the malignant cancers entitiescharacterized by the high level of heterogeneity in humansTherefore it is necessary to find accurate biomarkers forosteosarcomaIn recent years researchers have paid more and moreattention to the role of the tumor microenvironmentTME in malignant tumors The function of TME inthe tumorigenesis progression and therapy of tumorshave been initially understood [ ] More importantly Estimation of

prognostic biomarkers for osteosarcoma patients and two nomograms were developed for predicting the OS and DFS of osteosarcoma patientsrespectivelyIn recent years an increasing number of studiesfocused on the carcinogenesis and progression of tumorsbased on the TME and the ESTIMATE algorithm is oneof the most important quantitative tools for this researchfield Based on the ESTIMATE algorithm the association between the prognosis and TME has been initially 0cHu  BMC Cancer            Page  of elucidated in some tumors such as cervical squamouscell carcinoma gastric cancer cutaneous melanomaacute myeloid leukemia bladder cancer and clear cellrenal carcinoma [   �] However previousstudies indicated that TME scores serve as a differentrole in different tumors For example for hepatocellularcarcinoma gastric cancer acute myeloid leukemiabladder cancer and clear cell renal carcinoma patientswith high immune score have a worse prognosis [  �] However for cervical squamous cell carcinoma adrenocortical carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma patients with high immune score have a favorableprognosis [  ] Therefore we can find great heterogeneity among different tumors from the perspectiveof TME For osteosarcoma patients the present studyindicated that patients with higher immune score had abetter OS and DFS Hence the present study indicatedthat immune cells infiltrating tumor tissue may play animportant role in suppressing tumor progressionIn our research  TMErelated genes were identified by comparing the highscore and lowscore osteosarcoma patients The functional enrichment includingGO and KEGG analyses showed that TMErelated geneswere mainly involved in the immune features such asregulation of leukocyte activation MHC protein complex MHC protein and complex binding More importantly the unsupervised cluster analysis based on DEGswas performed and all patients were divided into twoclusters Immune score and T cell CD4 memory activated fraction were significant difference between twoclusters which further elucidated the relationship between DEGs and immune featuresDue to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patientsidentifying robust prognostic biomarker is very importantThe tumor immune microenvironment is closely relatedto the prognosis of bone tumor patients Emilie etal []performed the first genomewide study to describe therole of immune cells in osteosarcoma and found thattumorassociated macrophages are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survivalin highgradeosteosarcoma Recently the prognostic signature based onTMErelated genes have been established for many tumors [  ] but only one study focused on osteosarcoma patients [] Compared with the study performedby Zhang  [] we think that our research have someadvantages Firstly our signatures were established basedon several validated genes and both two signatures weresuccessfully validated in independent cohorts Secondlythe outcome of DFS was not reported in the previousstudy As reported in published studies tumor recurrenceis a terrible medical problem for osteosarcoma patientsand the 5year survival rate for osteosarcoma patients withmetastasis or relapse remains disappointing [ ]Hence the DFS nomogram can improve the managementof osteosarcoma patients Finally two nomograms incorporated TMErelated signature and clinical variables wereestablished in our research which further facilitated theclinical application of our findingsIn our research five genes were incorporated into thefinal prognostic signatures FCGR2B GFAP and MPP7were identified and validated as OSrelated biomarkerswhile CYP2S1 and ICAM3 were DFSrelated biomarkersThe role of these genes in tumor prognosis had beenwidely reported in previous studies [�] FCGR2Bhas been confirmed as an immunerelated gene previously [] Although the relationship between FCGR2Band prognosis in sarcoma patients had not been reported the prognostic value of FCGR2B had been widelyconfirmed in other cancerssuch as hepatocellularcarcinoma and glioblastoma [ ] In addition NewM etal [] demonstrated that MPP7 is novel regulatorsof autophagy which was thought to be responsible forthe prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaCYP2S1 described as Cytochrome P450 Family  Subfamily S Member  was reported significantly associatedwith colorectal cancer In primary colorectal cancerCYP2S1 was present at a significantly higher level ofintensity compared with normal colon [] More importantly the presence of strong CYP2S1 immunoreactivity was associated with poor prognosis [] The roleof ICAM3 in cancer was also widely reported in published studies and the Akt pathway plays an importantrole in the impact of ICAM3 on tumors YG Kim etal[] reported that ICAM3 can induce the proliferationof cancer cells through the PI3KAkt pathway Additionally JK Park etal showed that the ICAM3 can enhancethe migratory and invasive potential of human nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducing MMP2 andMMP9 via Akt pathway [] showed that the ICAM3can enhance the migratory and invasive potential ofhuman nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducingMMP2 and MMP9 via Akt pathwayAlthough the role of TME and TMErelated genes inosteosarcoma patients have been initially studied by bioinformatic and statistical analyses in our research somelimitations should be elucidated Firstly the treatmentinformation cannot be obtained from the TARGET database which may influence the prognosis of osteosarcomapatients Secondly two nomograms were generated andshowed good performance in our study However externalvalidation by a large cohort is needed Thirdly many independent prognostic genes for osteosarcoma patients wereidentified in the present study but the potential mechanism to influence osteosarcoma remains unclear Finally inthe training cohort  and  DEGs were identified asOS and DFSrelated DEGs respectively However onlyfive OS and five DFSrelated genes were identified in

locally advanced disease [�]More than  of all liver metastases develop in thefirst six months postoperatively [] These liver metastases are most likely already present at the time of diagnosis and have not been identified preoperatively as theyare too small to be detected by routine preoperativeultrasound and contrastenhanced CT CECT [ ]CECT is highly accurate in assessing the relationship ofthe tumor to critical arterial and venous structures sincetheir involvement can preclude surgical resection HoweverCECT has a poor sensitivity � for the detection andcharacterization of liver metastases [ �] especiallyfor subcentimeter metastases which are often present inpancreatic cancer [] This leads to futile surgical treatment with all the associated morbidity mortality and costsMoreover patients who were explored with curative intentand were found unresectable due to peritoneal or liver metastases had a worse overall survival compared to patientswith unexpected locally advanced disease []Nowadays diffusionweighted MR imaging DWI appears to be valuable in both detection and characterizationof focal liver lesions with a high sensitivity � evenfor subcentimeter lesions � [�] This technique can be used to detect and characterize liver lesionsbased on decreased diffusion of water molecules caused bytumoral hypercellularity and reduced extracellular spaceDWI is especially useful for detecting subcentimeter livermetastasesit is more accurate than conventional T2weighted imaging techniques because signal suppression ofintravascular flow is obtained black blood effect whilemaintaining good residual signal of the liver lesions [] Itis easy to implement and adds very little time to a standardMRI examination However without highquality evidenceof the benefit of MRI the use of MRI as part of the routineworkup is questioned and therefore not implemented Currently most guidelines advise to use MRI as a problemsolving tool in addition to CECT eg when the primarytumor cannot be visualized or in case of undefined liver lesions [�] The American Society of Clinical OncologyASCO leaves the choice of imaging modality in the handsof the physician [] MRI is

suspected PDAC for thedetection of liver metastases Additionally we will evaluatewhether performing contrastenhanced diffusionweightedMRI will improve the detection of liver metastases compared to CECT by determining the sensitivity and specificity of CECT for the detection of liver metastasesDespite the good diagnostic performance of MRI forliver metastases the benefits of MRI remain unclearmostly because of low level of evidence heterogeneityand bias in the performed studies Two recently published metaanalyses have suggested the results shouldbe confirmed by performing a welldesigned and sufficiently powered study directly comparing liver CT andMRI in the same cohort [ ]A major difficulty in the interpretation of the currentliterature is that most studies are retrospective oftenonly reporting on a subset of patients actually undergoing a resection patients with borderline resectable tumors or patients with indeterminate liver lesions onCECT These patients have a higher probability of 0cLitjens  BMC Cancer            Page  of having liver metastases However in an era of neoadjuvant therapy local ablative therapy for advanced tumorsexpensive targeted therapies and resection of oligometastases MRI may be beneficial to patients with allstages of PDAC Therefore all patients with suspectedPDAC are eligible for inclusion in the DIAPANCMRI field strength  T versus  T was a significant factor in the heterogeneity between studies that was found ina metaanalysis  T MRI had a higher sensitivity  anda lower specificity  for diagnosing liver metastasiscompared to  T MRI sensitivity  and specificity[] Because the signaltonoise ratio and thelesiontoliver contrast are higher on  T MRI than on T MRI it is reasonable that a  T MRI permits a higher lesion detection rate [ ] In the DIAPANC study weplan to perform all MRIs on a  T scanner A potentialdownside of a multicenter design is the intervendor variability that could occur when comparing the quantitativeApparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC value this variabilityseems to be more pronounced at  T than at  T []Availability of MRI is not expected to be an issue asMRI is available in every expert center for pancreaticdiseases However problems with MRI capacity couldarise due to the need for MRI within a short intervalafter CT A time interval of two weeks was chosen toprovide a feasible time frame for MRI to be performedand no intervallesions are expected within this timeinterval []The DIAPANC trial is the first international prospective multicenter cohort study about the diagnostic accuracyof contrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI On theWorld Health anization trial registry website ICTRPincorporating all inter national trial registries there areonly four other prospective trials registered in this fieldThe first trialis a completed French prospectivemulticenter trial presumably the only one prospective study that has been published [] The studyhas been performed in  patients with potentiallyresectable pancreatic cancer on a  T scanner usinggadobenate dimeglumine MultiHance as contrastagent The study has been performed to assess thediagnostic performance of diffusionweighted MRIfor the preoperative diagnosis of liver metastasis andthe modification of therapeutic strategy as a consequence ofliver metastasis ondiffusionweighted MRI []the diagnosis ofThe second trial is a British single center observational study with a target sample size of  patientswith confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer referred for pancreaticoduodenectomy and is completed recently The primary outcome of this studyis the proportion of patients correctly identified byMRI to have lymph node peritoneal or liver metastases To our knowledge the results have not beenpublished and there is no information on scan parameters and contrast agent available []The third trial from Australia is the only randomizedcontrolled trial The study has a target sample size of patients and is not yet recruiting The aim of the studyis to compare the 12month recurrence rate in patientswith locally operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with standard preoperative assessment of liver metastases with CECT versus preoperative assessment withliver specific contrast MRI []The fourth trial is a Chinese comparative study and isnot yet recruiting The study aims to compare liver specific contrast MRI and CECT in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer with a target sample size of  patients []The DIAPANC trial hypothesizes a superior value ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT To reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy thegold standard is histopathology of the liver lesions Considering it is not always possible and sometimes even unethical to obtain histopathological proof of every lesionfollowup is used as a reference standard Hence we areable to simultaneously gather information on early localrecurrence or metastases after resection disease progression and therapy response evaluation on MRI and CECTIn conclusion the DIAPANC trial is expected to report highlevel evidence of the diagnostic accuracy ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT resulting in significant value for clinical decisionmaking guideline development and improved stratification for treatment strategies and future trials Furthermore

extracts to treat patients with metastatic advanced breastcancer The condition was significantly alleviated sparkinginterest in exploring the relationship between thyroid andbreast cancer [] Subsequently a prospective study enrolled  women and  women with earlier diagnosisof hypothyroidism observed the occurrence of breast cancer during followup showed that low serum free thyroxine levels increased the risk of breast cancer [] In  aprospective women withhypothyroidism and  hyperthyroidism found thathypothyroidism slightly reduced the risk of breast cancer[] However a prospective cohort study of women with autoimmune hypothyroidism and women with normal thyroid function indicated that autoimmune hypothyroidism was not associated with breastcancer risk [] Besides some animal experiments alsoreflect the relationship between the two [ ] Animalexperiments by López Fontanafound thathypothyroidism mice inhibit the development of breastcancer and promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cellsdue to the low expression of βchain protein and activation of the apoptotic pathway on the tumour cell membrane [] Due to the inconsistency ofthe aboveconclusions we performed a metaanalysis to evaluate therelationship between hypothyroidism and breast cancerrisketalA total of  studies were included in this metaanalysis and the results showed that patients withhypothyroidism not related to the risk of breast cancerHowever there was significant heterogeneity among theincluded studies After subgroup analysis and sensitivityanalysis we found that Cristofanilli�s research may causeheterogeneity [] Cristofanilli�s research is a retrospective study and the diagnosis of hypothyroidism patientswas based on the information recorded in the medicalrecords which may lead to the bias risk of misclassification and have a positive impact on the positive results ofthis study [] After excluding Cristofanilli�s researchwe found that patients with hypothyroidism had a lowerrisk of breast cancer with borderline significance [] Theresults of the metaanalysis are inconsistent with the findings of Hardefeldt  and Angelousi  [ ] Perhaps because our study included more prospective studiesand Asian population cohort study In addition we evaluated the risk of breast cancer in thyroid hormone replacement therapy and show that patients who received thyroidhormone replacement therapy was not related to the riskof breast cancerIn the analysis of the European population the resultsshow that hypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breastcancer We also found that patients with hypothyroidismcan reduce the risk of breast cancer was borderline significance in the subgroup with more longer followupdate However the relationship between the two was notobserved in North American and Asian populationsThe possible reasons for these disparities may be as follows First followup time may be the main contributorsto this difference A longer followup is required to demonstrate the relationship between hypothyroidism andbreast cancer risk In the metaanalysis five studies provided North American population data and two reported Asian population data However only one ofseven nonEuropean studies� followup time for morethan  years Second the differences may be attributedto different ethnicities sharing different genegene andgeneenvironmental backgrounds Third social and environmental factors are another critical cause for thisdifference With these in mind our findings suggest thathypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breast canceronly in the European population and more largescalehighqualitylongterm prospective cohort studies arestill needed to study on different human populationsThe following may explain the potential relationshipbetween hypothyroidism and the risk of breast cancerHealthy mammary epithelial cells can express a largenumber of T3 receptors and breast cancer cells have asimilar ability to bind to T3 [] T3 has an estrogenlike effect that promotes the growth of mammary glandlobes and stimulates normal breast tissue differentiation[ ] Therefore T3 can mimic the effect of estrogenon the proliferation of breast cancer cells When theconcentration of T3 is low in vivo it may inhibit theproliferation of breast cancer cells Hypothyroidism mayreduce the risk of breast cancer by affecting T3concentrationSome basic experiments support this theory In GonzalezSancho  studied the relationship betweenT3 and breast cancer [] It was found that there is anoverexpressed T1 gene in human breast cancer cellsand T3 inhibits the proliferation of mammary epithelialcells by inhibiting the expression of cyclin D1 and T1thereby inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells 0cWang  BMC Cancer            Page  of Author

needs to be taken with caution as this study has several limitations First the studies that have been included do not adjust for importantrisk factors for breast cancer Second in subgroup analysis for

firstline treatmentinhibitor treatmentImmune checkpointis a newapproach for tumor immunotherapy [ ] The treatment diminishes the immune system tolerance to tumorcells and improves the effective identification and eradication of tumor cells by blocking T cell inhibition [] Theprogrammed death1 PD1 antibody specifically binds toPD1 thereby inhibiting apoptosis of antigenspecific Tcells and thus reducing regulatory T cell Treg apoptosisby inhibiting the activation of PDL1 [ ]patients with recurrent or advanced GC In the ATTRACTION2 study nivolumab monotherapy improvedOS from  to  months

which is considered to beassociated with T cell exclusion or exhaustion or inadequate T cell trafficking and many immunosuppressivefactors accumulate in the tumor microenvironment []New therapy regimens that improve the response andlongterm efficacy are desperately needed The efficacy ofantiPD1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy hasbeen confirmed in nonsmallcell lung cancer [ ] Inaddition to direct tumor killing conventional cytotoxicchemotherapy has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties by enhancing tumor antigenicity disturbing immunesuppressive pathways inducing immunogenic cell deathand increasing effector Tcell reactions [] It is safe tohypothesize that antiPD1 antibodies in combination withchemotherapy may further improve the clinical outcomesof patients with advanced GC Sintilimab is a highly selective monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interactionsbetween PD1 and its ligands with strong antitumorresponse [] A phase 1a study for dose escalation hasdemonstrated the tolerance and pharmacological activity ofsintilimab in patients with advancedstage solid tumors butthere is limited evidence for the efficacy of antibodiesagainst PD1 plus

the efficacy of PD1 treatments inconsistentresults have been reported in previous studies Wang  suggested that TMB might be associatedwith better efficacy for PD1 monotherapy [] whereasMishima  [] did not find a significant relationshipbetween TMB and the response of gastric cancers toPD1 therapy [] The latter data is in accordance withour finding that after treatment with sintilimab in combination with CapeOx no significant difference in theclinical responses was found between HTMB and LTMB patients However using the median TMB as acutoff is difficult to extrapolate to the real world clinicand bias due to the small sample size could not beexcluded in the present study In addition it has beennoted that up to now there is no uniform standard forHTMB [] and further investigations are

tumorigenesis and foundin human trophoblast and chorionic cell lines Studieshave shown that overexpression of TROP2 is associatedwith tumorigenesis and malignancy [�]In thisstudy TROP2 expression was observed to be a highlysensitive and specific marker of tongue squamous cellcarcinoma and tissue stiffness The relative thickness ofsamples helped accurately diagnose and determine thestaging of tongue squamous cell carcinomaImmunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of TROP2 in poorly differentiated OSCC tissueswas significantly higher than that in welldifferentiatedOSCC tissues Additionally TROP2 upregulation wascorrelated with tumors of advanced TNM III  IV staging and poor differentiation than that in tumors withlow TNM I  II staging Thus the abnormal expressionof TROP2 may be associated with the occurrence anddevelopment of tongue malignancies Furthermore highTROP2 expression predicted low survival as comparedto that in the tumors with low TROP2 expression Previous research has also demonstrated the correlation between shorter patient lifespan and high levels of TROP2as compared to that in patients with laryngeal squamouscell carcinoma and low levels of TROP2 [] TROP2possesses sites for tyrosineserine phosphorylation thatregulate signal transduction or its expression and activity thereby rendering cancer cells resistant to apoptosis[] Upregulated TROP2 correlates with the poor prognosis of thyroid papillary carcinoma [] colon cancer[] liver cancer [] and other malignanciesThere have been an increasing number of studies on thebiological role of TROP2 at the molecular level TROP2induces the downregulationloss of PTEN thereby stimulating PI3KAKT signaling and tumor development []PTEN is a wellknown tumor suppressor that is a phosphatase [] and affects the PI3KPKBAKT signaling axisduring the dephosphorylation of PIP2 and PIP3 []PI3K signaling is important in regulating tumor cell proliferation migration and invasion [ ] Thus PTEN is anegative regulator of cancer [ ] Li  have shownthat TROP2 activates epithelialmesenchymal transitionvia PI3KAKT signaling thereby promoting proliferationmigration and metastasis in gallbladder cancer [] Similarly TROP2 expression stimulates the proliferation migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells [] Hou et aldemonstrated that TROP2 regulates JAK2STAT3 signaling in glioblastoma cells []

to be elucidated HE staining isthe gold standard for tumor diagnosis With the development of biomechanics in the past two decades [] the mechanical properties of tissues need to be investigated based on biomedical and physical parametersIn this study we have assayed the changes in mechanicalproperties at the micronanometer level using AFM anddetermined the association between the TNM

percutaneousnerve filtration and vascular invasion Moreover high levelsof TROP2 correlated with poor overall survival in patientsHighly differentiated cancer tissues exhibited increasedsurface roughness and stiffness Lastly high TROP2 expression resulted in reduced tumor stiffness However thisstudy had some limitations First the cohort used in thisstudy was relatively small Second we did not employ molecular methods of analysis such as western blotting orenzymelinked immunosorbent assay Thus using a largerpatient cohort and multiple techniques in molecular andcell biology will help validate our findings and developTROP2 as a specific and efficient prognostic biomarker forOSCCConclusionThese findings could promote new methods for the earlyOSCC diagnosis depend on the stage of

JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0cThyroid  diseases  requiring  surgery  are  relatively uncommon in children compared to adults The prevalence  of  palpable  thyroid  nodules  in  children  ranges  from    to    Sporadic  welldifferentiated thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy in children accounting for  of pediatric cancers  in  the  prepubertal  age  group  and  up  to   of cancers in adolescents aged � year2 The most common indication for thyroid surgery in children varies among published studies but thyroidectomy for malignant conditions is rising38 Data in children throughout the  world  are  relatively  scarce  The  objective  of  this study was to analyze the clinical data and outcome of thyroid  surgery  in  a  large  series  of  children  treated  at a  single  center  at  King  Faisal  Specialist  Hospital  and Research Center KFSHRC in RiyadhPATIENT AND METHODS With the approval of the Institutional Review Board IRB at KFSHRC the medical records of all patients  years old and younger who underwent a thyroid surgery between    and    were  retrospectively  reviewed We elected to include patients up to the year  to ensure a reasonable followup period Patients for the study were identified by a search of the operating room log for all procedures involving the thyroid gland for the specified age groupDemographic  data  clinical  features  and  surgical outcomes  were  collected  Specific  data  that  were  obtained included age at operation gender family history presenting  symptoms  history  of  radiation  exposure presence of multiple

recurrent  laryngeal nerve paralysis wound infection and hematoma length of stay and radioactive iodine treatment and recurrences Thyroid procedures in this series included hemithyroidectomy  subtotal  total  and  completion  thyroidectomy Surgeries were performed by either an endocrine adult surgeon or a pediatric surgeon No intraoperative nerve monitoring was used Early in the series procedures were performed by adult endocrine surgeons but lately a combined approach was adopted where pediatric surgeons and adult endocrine surgeons collaborated in such cases  proceduresthe normal range in our laboratory regardless of symptoms Transient hypocalcemia was identified if it lasted for less than  months while permanent hypocalcemia was  considered  if  the  serum  calcium  level  remained below normal range and the patient continued on calcium  supplementation  after    months  of  the  surgery All patients with a family history of MEN  underwent genetic testing of the RET protooncogene to confirm the diagnosis All patients who underwent completion thyroidectomy  had  a  preoperative  and  postoperative vocal  cords  assessment  at  the  Otolaryngology  clinic

 there was no clear data whether those patients received RAI before or only after a recurrence All local recurrences  underwent  resection  except  for  one  patient who was lost follow up There was no mortality in this study DISCUSSIONThe most common indication for thyroidectomy in this series was thyroid nodule which correlates with previously published reports in the pediatric population35 Children with thyroid nodules have an estimated fourfold  higher  risk  of  developing  thyroid  cancer  compared to adults910 The high incidence of malignancy in this series suggests children with a thyroid nodule should be carefully evaluatedFNA is a valuablemethod for preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules However there are limitations on  the  routine  use  of  FNA  in  children  including  the need  for  sedation  sampling  errors  and  the  limited availability  of  experienced  cytopathologists11  Many previous studies reported high sensitivity and specificity of FNA in evaluating thyroid nodule in children1114 which correlate with our findingsOur data showed lymph node metastasis in  of  thyroid  cancer  cases  which  supports  the  notion that  children  with  thyroid  cancer  frequently  present with more extensive disease than adults Lymphnode involvement  at  diagnosis  is  seen  in    to    of children  compared  with    to    of  adults  with differentiated thyroid cancer1523 Because our hospital is the largest referral center in Saudi Arabia especially for oncology cases this may explain the large number of lymph node and distant metastasis In this cohortThe  most  common  complication  reported  after thyroidectomy in children is hypoparathyroidism with an incidence ranging between  to  which original PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI MED  JULYAUGUST WWWANNSAUDIMEDNET 0ccorresponds with our results of  which are reported as hypocalcemia in Table    One study found that total thyroidectomy central and bilateral neck dissection Graves� disease and malignancy were  risk  factors  for  hypocalcemia  after  thyroid  surgery3 In this cohort postoperative hypocalcemia was noted more in malignant cases but it failed to reach statistical significance Moreover there was no significant difference between benign and malignant cases in  terms  of  mean  age  gender  distribution  recurrent laryngeal nerve injury or overall complications a finding that was reported previously26 Multiple studies in recent years have found an inverse relationship between surgeon volume and complication  rates2728  but  similar  data  in  the  pediatric population is lacking One study found that highvolume  endocrine  surgeons  have  better  outcomes  and shorter lengths of stay and lower costs after thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy in children compared to pediatric surgeons general surgeons or otolaryngologists29  Scheumann  and  colleagues  also  concluded that a collaborative approach between pediatric and endocrine surgeons would have better outcomes This has led other authors to suggest that a combined approach with endocrine and pediatric surgeons in addition to pediatric endocrinologists may optimize the care of children with surgical thyroid disease given the low number of pediatric patients4 Our data do not allow for comparisons of different approaches given the late adoption of the combined approach The  recurrence  rate  for  thyroid  cancer  in  children after  thyroidectomy  has  varied  widely  in  reported studies  ranging  from    to    while  it  was   in  this  cohort  Only  a  few  studies  explored  the predictors  of  recurrence  Lymph  node  involvement multiple nodules male gender younger age histologic subtype and advanced tumor stage were risk factors associated with recurrence17233033 In  this  study    of  patients  with  malignant  lesions received RAI Although there are conflicting data regarding  the  indications  of  postoperative  RAI  treatment in lowrisk patients the current recommendation is that lowrisk patients can be treated without RAI3436There are some limitations to this study The retrospective nature may affect the validity and quality of the data The small number of cases in some categories did not enable us to compare groups and explore predictors relative to these factors On the other hand this study adds to the scarce data on thyroid surgery in pediatric age group Malignancy is the commonest indication  for  thyroid  surgery  in  children  and  FNA  is highly  diagnostic  Hypocalcemia  and  recurrent  laryngeal nerve injury are significant complications Cancerrelated  death  is  extremely  rare  but  recurrence  is  not uncommon and a significant number of patients with malignant cases received RAI treatmentoriginal PEDIATRIC THYROID SURGERYANN SAUDI

is based on four exclusive queries that return  four  disjoint  citation  subsets The first query QPub_plain is based on a plaintext search in PubMed titles and s using keywords The  second  query  QPub_indexed relies on the PubMed indexing scheme using MeSH terms and results are made exclusive of the previous set The third one QWoS_restricted is based on a plaintext search in WoS restricted to the two research areas �Medical Informatics� and �Health Care Sciences  Services� The fourth query QWoS_filtered is based on the same plaintext search used in WoS but filtered by nonrelevant research areas eg Archeology Dance Zoology etc and the two research areas of the previous query It is of note that the two WoS queries select  only  nonPubMedindexed  papers that are supposed to be caught by the two PubMed queriesA  first  review  of  the  four  subsets  of retrieved  citations  was  performed  by  the two section editors to select  candidate best papers Following the IMIA Yearbook protocol these candidate best papers were then individually reviewed and rated by both section editors the chief editor of the Decision Support section and external reviewers from the international Medical Informatics community Based on the reviewers� ratings and comments the Yearbook editorial committee then selected the best papers of the year in the decision support domainIMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics                                    IMIA and Ge Thieme Verlag KG 0cReview Results The    literature  search  has  been  performed on January   A total of  unique references were obtained distributed as follows  for QPub_plain  for QPub_indexed  for QWoS_restricted and  for QWoS_filtered yielding subtotals of  references from PubMed and  from WoS Compared to the previous year the global query retrieved   more  papers After  a  first  individual screening independently performed by both section editors based on the title and  of papers  not rejected by both section editors were discussed by the two editors to achieve a final selection of  candidate best  papers After  the  external  review  of these    s  the  editorial  committee finally selected three of them as best papers for  [�] Table  They are discussed in the next section and summaries of their contents are available in the AppendixDiscussion and OutlookIn the first paper Hendriks  [] propose an approach to the modeling of clinical practice guidelines which certainly builds on already existing approaches but which is systematically conducted in order to be scalable and used to represent complex guidelines They promote the formalism of clinical decision trees CDTs as they are both clinically interpretable  by  healthcare  professionals and  computerinterpretable  thus  suitable for implementation in datadriven CDSSs The disambiguation of textual guidelines is supported first by the formal unequivocal specification of data items used as decision criteria using international coding systems to enforce interoperability and second by the representation of guideline knowledge as CDTs The method is applied to the Dutch breast cancer guidelines Sixty CDTs were built  involving  a  total  of    data  items among  which    could  not  be  linked  to standard terminologies The authors report the ambiguity of certain criteria which could be subjective or had multiple definitions The resulting knowledge base was implemented in a decision support application where it can be interactively browsed or automatically executed By modeling guidelines in such a way this work is a step forward in the sharing of encoded knowledgeIn the second paper Kamišalić  [] tackled the issues linked to the formalization of the medical processes used for managing chronic diseases and their execution in CDSSs They analyzed the decisionmaking dimensions of the therapeutic management of chronic diseases like those known to increase the cardiovascular risk and identified three basic levels therapy strategy dosage adaptation and intolerance management To handle these  different  aspects  consistently  they propose a formalism called extended Timed Transition Diagram eTTD With eTTDs they illustrate the multilevel and finegrained modeling required to capture the contents of arterial hypertension management guidelines This detailed demonstration on how procedural knowledge for hypertension management can be formalized to develop a CDSS could certainly be used in other medical domainsThe third paper by Khalifa  [] presents a conceptual and practical framework to help assess confidence in predictive tools GRASP  for  Grade  and Assess  Predictive Tools is both a method to look for evidence from the published literature and an analysis grid It standardizes the assessment of the available literature associated to a predictive tool and the grading of its level of proof Three phases of evaluation are considered i before the implementation of the tool to assess both its internal and external validity ii during the implementation to assess its potential effect and usability and iii after the implementation to assess its effectiveness and safety In each phase the level of evidence  can  be  assessed  from  the  study design A qualitative  summarizes the direction of evidence positive negative mixed This grid can be considered as similar to existing grids for instance the CONSORT statement for clinical trials However it gives a rigorous methodology for a critical appraisal of predictive tools and could be extended to all kind of CDSSs It might be a useful tool to extend the evidencebased culture in the field of medical informaticsBesides the three best papers selected for the  Decision  Support section  of  the   edition of the IMIA Yearbook several other works retrieved from the literature review deserve to be cited Some of them deal with the personalization of decisions Laleci   []  propose  a  scientific  and  technical approach to develop personalized care plans that comply with clinical practice guidelines for the management of complex polypathology situations Jafarpour  [] propose a solution to dynamically manage the conflicts that can rise in this type of complex contexts Ben Souissi  [] introduce the use of health  information  technology  involving multiple criteria decision to support the choice between antibiotics alternatives Interestingly other works promote the creation and sharing of operational knowledge bases as exemplified by Hendriks  [] Thus Huibers  [] transform the textual STOPPSTART criteria into

narrative and described in large textual documents the aim of this work was to model complex guidelines as datadriven clinical decision trees CDTs that could be still humaninterpretable while computerinterpretable for implementation in decision support systems The Dutch national breast cancer guidelines were translated into CDTs Data items  which  characterize  the  patient  and the tumor and represent decisional criteria were encoded unambiguously using existing classifications and coding systems related to breast cancer when feasible In total  CDTs  were  necessary  to  cover  the  whole guidelines driven by  data items Of all data items   could be coded using existing classification and coding systems All  CDTs represented  unique patient subpopulations Complex guidelines could be transformed as systematically constructed modular datadriven CDTs that are clinically interpretable and executable in a decision support applicationKamišalić A Ria�o D Kert S Welzer T Nemec Zlatolas LMultilevel medical knowledge formalization to support medical practice for chronic diseasesData  Knowledge Engineering  �This research is focused on knowledge representation to support the medical processes involved in chronic diseases management which can be viewed as a procedural and sequential  application  of  knowledge An intuitive easy and effective mechanism for medical  knowledge  formalization  is  proposed through a formalism called extended Timed Transition  Diagram  eTTD This formalism allows for the consistent representation of three basic levels of decision making that should be taken into account in the prescription and adaptation of longterm treatment therapy strategy dosage and intolerances The methodology can be manually applied to build eTTDs from clinical practice guidelines eTTDs implementation is demonstrated by modeling clinical practice guidelines for the therapeutic management of arterial hypertension The obtained models can be used as a baseline framework for the development of decision support systems involving medical proceduresKhalifa M Magrabi F Gallego BDeveloping a framework for evidencebased grading and assessment of

venous graft failure after bypass proceduresIntroductionCoronary artery bypass grafting CABG is a method of choicefor revascularization in patients with multivessel disease anddiabetes mellitus DM Although arterial grafts are preferredin selected scenarios the common practice is to use leftinternal thoracic artery LITA to bypass the left anteriordescending artery LAD and to place venous conduits toother target vessels An often chosen vascular graft the greatsaphenous vein SV offers decent durability and is easy toharvest SV graft occlusion may occur in up to  of caseswithin the ﬁrst  months and as many as  may occludewithin ﬁrst  to  weeks1 SV harvesting dramaticallychanges the vein�s environment with disruption of bloodﬂow in vasa vasorum damage to the adventitia hypoxia

grafting SV saphenous veins TF tissue factorA normal SV is composed of the intima the media and theadventitia8 The intima is built of the layer of endothelial cellson the luminal side the media consists of smooth musclecells and the adventitia forms the outer part8 In a normalsetting the endothelium is crucial for vein integrity andprevention of thrombosis9 and its focal disruption maypredispose to vessel thrombosis2 SV manipulation andimplantation leads to loss of endothelial integrity and elicitsan inﬂammatory response with platelet adhesion and leukocyte recruitment Notwithstanding an overt thrombosis isextremely rare in the operating room SV dissection results inblood ﬂow disruption in vasa vasorum and causes adventitial damage hypoxia and vessel wall hyponutrition10 Acuteperioperative saphenous vein graft failure is almost always aresult of graft thrombosis but this very uncommonly occursprior to graft placement Surgical factorslike technicalanastomotic failure or severe disproportion between thetarget vessel and the graft may lead to thrombosis butvessel injury and hypercoagulability are among potentialcauses as well11There was no evident inﬂammatory process in microscopy inour patient but even if an inﬂammatory process was presentTH  Vol  No 0cBilateral Saphenous Vein Thrombosis during CABG Mazur et ale201preoperatively in our patient�s SVs the inﬂammatory background alone could not explain the dramatic intraoperativethrombosis We hypothesized that increased thrombin generation and prothrombotic ﬁbrin clot phenotype were responsiblefor the clinical presentation Conversion of ﬁbrinogen to ﬁbrinfacilitated by thrombin is a concluding step of coagulation Ithas been shown that ﬁbrin clots with small pores betweentightly packed thin ﬁbrin ﬁbers are relatively lysis resistant12Such clot phenotype has been evidenced in multiple thromboticpathologies such as myocardial infarction6 ischemic stroke13and venous thromboembolism4 The prothrombotic clotphenotype reﬂected by a tendency to form dense ﬁbrin clotsresistant to lysis has been previously reported in patients withinstent thrombosis14 While routine thrombophilia screeningresults in a high almost  detection rate of commonhypercoagulable states15 there are prothrombotic conditionsthat escape routine diagnostic approach The overall microscopic clot appearance and prothrombotic ﬁbrin properties lead tothe discovery of two mutations in our patient that are notroutinely tested during thrombophilia screening namely ﬁbrinogen 455G  A and FXIII100G  TElevated ﬁbrinogen was postulated as one of the riskfactors for early graft failure after CABG1116 Epidemiologicalstudies have established that elevated ﬁbrinogen is stronglyassociated with cardiovascular diseases17 A  metaanalysis of individual records of  participants from prospective studies revealed that age and sexadjustedhazard ratio per  gL increase in usual ﬁbrinogen level forcoronary heart disease was   conﬁdence interval [CI]� while for stroke the hazard ratio was as high as 95CI � Risk of coronary disease progression wasalso linked to genetic polymorphisms of the ﬁbrinogen geneDe Maat et al found that A allele of ﬁbrinogen 455G  Awas associated with more severe progression of coronarydisease as documented angiographically18 Gu and colleagues in a metaanalysis of  studies with  patientsfound that A allele of the ﬁbrinogen 455G  A is associated with susceptibility to coronary disease and also withischemic stroke odds ratio for stroke �  [ CI �]for AA þ GA vs GG19 In a recent study of patients with atrialﬁbrillation Hu and colleagues found that the A allele of ﬁbrinogen 455G  A was a risk factor for cardioembolicstroke probably by elevating the level of plasma ﬁbrinogen20 On the other hand in a  metaanalysis of studies involving  cases and  controls FXIIIVal34Leu polymorphism was shown to be associated withrisk myocardial infarction21 FXIII is crucial to thrombusstabilization and changes of its plasma concentration reﬂectnonspeciﬁcally the extent of thrombosis as shown by Li et alin a study on patients with cerebral venous thrombosis22Interesting associations of FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism andthrombotic disorders have been reported Jung et al reportedin a metaanalysis of  studies that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss23Although no association with the incidence of ischemicstroke was found for this polymorphism24 apparentlywhen the stroke occurs Val34Leu polymorphism of FXIIIaffects the severity of its outcome25 Furthermore Kreutzand colleagues suggested in  that FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism may increase risk of recurrent MI and death inpatients with angiographically established coronary arterydisease26 In  our group has shown in a study of patients that in patients undergoing CABG FXIII Leu34 alleleis associated with decreased ﬁbrin clot permeability andefﬁciency of ﬁbrinolysis27ConclusionOur extensive workup showed that ﬁbrinogen HaeIII andFXIII Val34Leu polymorphisms are reﬂected in reduced clotpermeability and susceptibility to lysis These mutationslikely contributed to intraoperative saphenous graft thrombosis Further studies are needed to elucidate the role ofthese polymorphisms in early graft failure after bypassgrafting procedures however their

highincidence and low mortality2clinicalRecentimprovementsin highfrequencyultrasonic diagnostic technologies and theapplication of ultrasoundguided puncturetechniques have led to an apparent increasein the incidence of PTC year by year3�Regardingthyroidtumors the palpation detection rate forthyroid microtumors in the general population is about  compared with as highas  to  for highfrequency ultrasound6 which has thus greatly improveddisease diagnosisdiagnosistheofSurgical resection is a routine treatmentfor thyroid tumors but the recurrence rateis usually high and the consequent reduction in thyroid function can seriously affectthe patient�s quality of life7 Associatedwith the increasing detection rate of thyroidtumors and the pursuit of minimally invasive treatments radiofrequency ablationRFA has been gradually applied in theclinic RFA uses local hyperthermia tocause tissue necrosis The thermal effectsdo not depend on the tissue type andmost lesions can be completely eliminatedby RFA89 RFA has thus become a novellocal treatment for tumorsThe clinical diagnosis of benign andmalignant thyroid tumors currently dependson the clinical manifestations

serum levels MMP2and MMP9 were lower in the ﬁrst monthafter surgery compared with before surgerybut the difference was not signiﬁcant Thismight be because before ablationthetumor parenchyma induced the tumorstroma to produce larger amounts ofMMP2 and MMP9 which were releasedinto the blood These results suggest thatfailure to completely ablate the tumor ortumor recurrence may result in the

and accurate2526 RFA is considered an effectiveand safe treatment for control of BTNsIn most cases the incidence of haemorrhage and other complications is low20However haemorrhage is sometimes lifethreatening because serious haematomasmay compress the upper airways Manyreports have described active bleedingduring FNA of thyroid nodules and RFAof hepatocellular carcinomas14�� andsome reports have described fatalities14ThusimportantcomplicationhaemorrhageanisThree types of haemorrhage may occurperithyroidal subcapsular and intranodular121427� The mechanism of haemorrhage is thoughtto be related to themechanical or thermal injuries induced bythe RFA electrode tip3031 Thyroid nodulesreportedly have abundant capsular vesselsthat are usually anastomosed with vesselspenetrating into the core32 These numerousvessels are abnormal thinwalled and susceptible to rupture Large thyroid nodulesare another cause of haemorrhage becausemultiple insertions are often required totreat such nodules In additionthepatient cannot coordinate with the physician during the RFA procedure the perithyroidal orintrathyroidal vessels mayeasily be damaged by movement of theneedle tip or production of heat

patientscan endure the procedure under local anaesthesia however anxious patients mayrequire general anaesthesia to achieve cooperation If possible smallbore electrodesshould be chosen to decrease the risk ofbleeding35 It is necessary to cauterise thesupplying vasculature of nodules to avoidrecurrence and residue Howeverthepuncture route should be carefully designedto avoid pericapsular vessels and the electrode tip should be closely monitoredActive bleeding during needle puncture isvisible as a rapidly expanding hypoechoicor anechoic signal Locating the haemorrhagic focus is not difﬁcult with CEUSguidance The bleeding pointcan beblocked by RF electrode tip insertion anddirect ablation When the bleeding is toorapid to control with the RF electrode tipby increasing the power drug injection is asuitable alternative Lyophilised thrombin 0cHu et alpowder can be dissolved in normal salineand then injected at the bleeding pointthrough a syringe with US guidance Onereport also described haemorrhage treatedby local injection of hypertonic saline andepinephrine solution in a patient with hepatocarcinoma36 Mildbleeding whichappears as a hypoechoic layer can mostlybe controlled using ice and compression ofthe neck for several minutes after the procedure30 All bleeding can be controlled byconservative methodsthus no surgicalintervention is needed Ecchymosis can befound after the procedure and usually disappears in approximately  to  weeksPostprocedure CEUS is indispensablefor all patients regardless of whether bleeding occurs CEUS is an objective evaluationtool for active bleeding37 Close clinicalobservation for  hours postoperatively isrecommended in our department becausemost bleeding occurs during the ﬁrstlobectomy38Observation of the neck can help to detecta haematoma early and may aid in preventing serious adverse effectsthyroidhoursafterConclusionAcute thyroid bleeding is one possible complication of RFA although rare it is potentially lifethreatening Proper selection ofpatients and sufﬁcient preparation areessential During the RFA procedureboth an effective clinical strategy and adequate technical skills are indispensable Thephysician should trace the electrode tipusing realtime US and sufﬁciently managebleeding Mild bleeding has limited morbidity and can be easily controlled by compression Active bleeding tends to be rarehowever it may be disastrous if the operator is unaware or careless Direct ablationwith the RF electrode tip and drug injectioninto the bleeding focus are effective modalities for active bleeding CEUS and

interesting toexplore whether the prosthesis materialinﬂuencesthepeak effect and the duration of the effectand if so what mechanisms affect the bonemicrostructure and whether there is a wayto change the outcome by blocking thiseffect during a 2year followup We currently have one option for prevention oravoidance of adverse events and thesechanges in treatment strategies may play akey role in improving the clinical resultsif the effects of the prosthesis materialitself cannot be blocked18 There is still alack of consensus on standards for prosthesis revision in this context19When assessing the impact of CTA onthe target events we did not observe anincreased incidence of severe orthopaediccomplications other than the complicationsmentioned in this study In one systematicreview the authors presumed that CTA wassuperior to UTA with respect to functionalscores and tolerable orthopaedic complications20 We obtained analogous results interms of hiprelated complications andfunctional scores Multicentre hip arthroplasty data indicate that UTA remains ahighrisk factor for late revision looseningand periprosthetic fractures810 The notabledissimilarities in the results of these variousstudies on hiprelated complications may belargely attributed to the design of the prosthesis prosthesis size and material selection and the surgeon�s experience46affected theThis study has several limitations It hada small sample and its retrospective designis association with some inherent disadvantages We did not stratify the patientsaccording to fracture type or sex In addition the potential comorbidities betweengroups were not well exposed and compared The statistical power used to addressdifferences between the groups was insufﬁcient Differences in the patients� baselinedata may haveresultsFurthermore our analysis did not determine whether the deaths were instigatedby bone cement The risk of hiprelatedcomplications was not analysed The survivalcurve of other prosthesisrelatedcomplications was estimated using theKaplan�Meier method and competitiverisks ie death could have affected thesurvival of the prosthesis Patients whodied lostrevisionHence the revision rate might have beenunderestimated during this long followupwith a fairly high mortality ratethe opportunity forevidenceIn conclusion the ﬁndings described inthe current review uphold an increasingbody ofthat CTA provideshigher functional scores and lower rates ofhiprelated complications than does UTAin elderly patients with osteoporotic displaced FNFs AOOTA 31BC In thiscontext we

the Laurenclassification or the World Health anization WHO criteria The Lauren classification compares tumors based ongrowth invasion pattern with  subtypes intestinal well differentiated diffuse poorly differentiated and intermediatemixed67 The majority of patients outside US with GC areyounger 60years old and have the poorly differentiated diffuse subtype which is located within the distal portion of thestomach characterized by poor cellular differentiation and highintratumor heterogeneity This subtype has poorer outcomesdue to its widespread infiltration and invasive nature of thedisease78 Conversely within the United States the pathologyof GC is similar to that of malignancies found within the gastroesophageal junction8 Older patients are primarily impactedand the disease is commonly well differentiated intestinalThe welldifferentiated subtype is found in the cardia or lowerregion of the stomach with welldefined glandular structuresand growth pattern The WHO designation for GC was createdin  and expands vastly on the Lauren classification67There are  subtypes tubular adenocarcinoma papillary adenocarcinoma mucinous adenocarcinoma poorly cohesiveSignet ring cell carcinoma and mixed carcinoma67 Similarities exist between the Lauren and WHO classificationsSignetring cell carcinoma comparable to poorly differentiatedGC is steadily increasing in incidence within the United Statesand around the world9 This increase is attributed to  eradication efforts of Helicobacter pylori a pathogen known toinduce intestinal type GC  increases in genetic predisposition to genes such as Ecadherin CDH1 hypermethylationand  less screening and detection due to the �low risk�population within the United States compared to other regionssuch as Japan10Here we aim to analyze the molecular signatures as well asdifferences between Lauren classified GCs We also aim tounderstand the molecular differences between male and femalepatients with GC We chose to

markersincluding SOX17 hypermethylation BCL2 transforminggrowth factor beta TGFb vascular endothelial growth factorVEGFR and HER21418 Many of these proposed markersare studied extensively and do not serve as ideal targets dueto their limited clinical utility as either drug targets or predictors of therapeutic response Some examples of this include lesssuccessful attempts to target HER2 with monoclonal antibodiesand the use of TGFb inhibitors which although promisinghave proven to be highly toxic1920 Additionally these targetshave demonstrated limited clinical utility due to the crosstalkbetween TGFb and other signaling pathways such as RAS aknown nontargetable protein2122 While VEGF inhibitors areused as a therapeutic modality in GC they do not improveoverall survival23 An indepth investigation of the molecularmechanisms are urgently and investigations need to be distinctfrom the commonly studied and clinically intractable targetsAlthough this is the case discrepancies exist within the literature as some groups look at the molecular composition of GC asa whole while others focus on differences within the Laurenclassification systemUsing the Oncomine database we have found significantupregulation in several understudied genes in all GCs including COL3A1 COL5A2 SPON2 and CDH11 Table  Wealso have confirmed the upregulated status of many of thegenes found within the literature that are somewhat well knownsuch as INHBA a gene associated with poor overall outcomes24 but are still understudied Claudin  CLDN1 hasbeen found to be highly expressed in GC and is a poor predictive disease marker by mediating tumor necrosis factorainduced cell migration enhancement of proliferation andmetastasis while SULF1 has been found to be significantlyhypomethylated causing significant downregulated proteinexpression2528 This SULF1 downregulation may be indicativeof a posttranslational modification feedback loop or degradation event via protein�protein interactions but is still unclearNot surprisingly a significant underrepresentation was notedwhen comparing publications related to these genes over publications to the commonly studied genes such as MAPKPI3K and TP53 over  total publicationsGenetic Analysis of Upregulated GC Genes Using LaurenType Classified GCsWe stratified the data sets based on the respective Lauren distinguished subtype and have highlighted the vast heterogeneticmolecular landscape within the poorly differentiated diffusewell differentiated intestinal and mixed GC subtypesTable  Poorly differentiated GC shares many similaritieswith GC overall including perturbations in various collagentranscribing genes stimulation of PI3KAKT signaling andperturbations in cellular structural components This is a dominant subtype throughout the world for reasons we have previously mentioned Due to the overabundance of collagentranscribing genes we wanted to explore whether a potentialgenetic link exists Literature search identified a study correlating EhlersDanlos syndrome EDS a disease caused bycollagen gene perturbations to the development of GC29EhlersDanlos syndrome also presents with gastrointestinalinvolvement such as increased rates of heartburn which is arisk factor for developing esophageal cancer3031 Based on thelocation of these gastric tumors within the stomach that is inthe proximal stomach near the esophagus and the connectionbetween gastric and esophageal cancers it is quite possiblethere may be a much stronger correlation between EDS anddiffuse GC than previously thoughtWe have found GC overall does not share many molecularsimilarities with the welldifferentiated subtype of GC withinthe scope of our analysis We have found only a similarityCLDN1 expression Claudin  is a gene involved in coding forthe protein involved in epithelial barrier functions and is part ofthe claudin family Within GC CLDN1 has found to be differentially expressed in GC and has been found to be upregulatedin a small patient population being linked to poor survival outcomes indicative of an oncogenic function32 Other groupshave found claudin1 has tumor suppressive activities and canreverse the epithelialtomesenchymal transition in GC cellsand was found to be downregulated in intestinal type GC in aof  patients cohort3334 It is clear that work needs to be donein order to elucidate the role CLDN1 plays within

distinctly different but we did find similarity with THY1expression both having similar fold changes Although thisgene has not been investigated in GC it is overexpressed inthe pancreatic cancer microenvironment35 Further investigation may be needed as this gene may have importance in GCdevelopmentWe finally investigated the mixed subtype of GC a subtypethat is commonly overlooked within the

protectingtumors from 5flurouracil 5FUinduced death a chemotherapy commonly used to treat GC3738 It is likely the diffusesubtype is not the only subtype with a strong genetic link butthe mixed subtype may have a stronger genetic component thanpreviously thought We hypothesize some of the genetic diversity within GC is masked when analyzed as a whole whichfurther supports the notion of this disease

many of the interacting proteins are not aswell studied as AKT1 various genes such as MTUS1 PGAP3ALDOA and PMP22 have been shown within the literature toonly influence GC but pancreatic cancer as

We are working toward not onlycharacterizing this novel interaction but also using this information to uncover novel genes pertinent to GC growth anddevelopmentGenetic Analysis of Downregulated GC Genes UsingLauren Type Classified GCsWe stratified the data sets based on the respective Lauren distinguished subtype as we did previously and have highlightedthe vast heterogenetic molecular landscape within the diffuseintestinal and mixed Table  GC subtypes All subtypes areexpectedly distinct from one another within our molecular analysis The diffuse and intestinal type GCs seem to have moreprominent downregulation of metabolism related genes suchas GSTA2 and DBT GSTA2 is involved with chemoresistancedue to the action of glutathione metabolism an antioxidant andthis observation suggests that this subtype may be more sensitiveto platinum drugs56 This overall downregulation of metabolicpathways may also point to an increase in the Warburg effectThis alternative metabolic pathway has been suggested to contribute phenotypically to high rates of invasion and aggressiveGCs57 We also observed downregulation of ADRB2 in theintestinal type GC Table  Zhang et al described ADRB2signaling as essential in GC and is likely related to stressinduced tumor induction58 They suggest treating with antagonists of ARDB2 likely will provide survival benefit This may beimportant to note and be beneficial for nonintestinal like GCsbecause there is a clear trend of significant downregulation ofthis gene   fold differenceWe next assessed the molecular aberrations in the

rheumatoid arthritis6061 Again themixed subtype is molecularly different from the intestinal anddiffuse gastric subtypes based on this genetic pathway analysiswith notably less involvement of metabolism related genesAlthough this is expected due to its difference in subtypingthe mixed gastric subtype has a much smaller representationwithin the literature than the intestinal and diffuse types and itis clear that further investigation is needed A better understanding of the diverse nature of downregulated genes in allaspects of GC is needed as a first step to identify new therapeutic options that will benefit patients with GCGastric Cancer Exhibits High Molecular DifferencesBetween GendersWithin the United States men and women older than  are athigher risk for developing GC while the male population ishigher in risk for welldifferentiated GC development than thefemale population mainly due to the protective effect of estrogen against developing H pylori induced gastric carcinogenesis62 Females have higher incidence of poorly differentiatedGCs compared to their male counterparts for reasons largelyunknown Various environmental factors play a role in diseasedevelopment as a whole including obesity smoking drinkingand a poor diet6366 A retrospective study by Kim et al hasshown that women not only have a higher incidence of diffusetype GC but have a worse overall prognosis as well as geneticdifferences compared to men including ERb expression67 suggesting a hormonal component may also be a contributing factor to this subset of disease Due to the evident genderdisparities in GC we investigated the underlying moleculardifferences between male and female patients by preformingGEO2R analysis on the GSE118916 data set Our results showstriking differences in differentially expressed genes betweenmales and femalesOverall both male and female patients with GC showed anabundance of upregulated genes Figure 2A After stratifyingbased on gender the female patients with GC have a higherabundance of upregulated genes oncogenic like genes genes greater than 5fold upregulation compared to downregulated genes Figure 2B while male patients with GC have agreater abundance of downregulated genes tumor suppressorlike genes Figure 2B This trend can also be seen from just thetop differentially expressed genes in the provided tables Current treatment options for GC are somewhat limited in achieving a longterm survival benefit and we wanted to use ourcohorts to identify whether there are differences in actionabletargets between gendersFemale Patients With GC Are Vastly UnderrepresentedWithin Clinical StudiesWe found no direct druggable targets according to the DGIdbdatabase with the top differentially expressed genes Therefore we looked further into the individual protein�proteininteraction networks using STRING database Figure 2CFBroadening the scope of our search allowed us to find manypotential druggable targets Table  We narrowed the scopeof our search to inhibitorsantagonist type compounds due tothe substantial genes found to be upregulated Many of thedruggable targets such as estimated glomerular filtration rateEGFR tyrosine

difference in overall survival for Paclitaxel plus Lapatinib overPaclitaxel alone70 We looked further into the patient demographics of the TyTAN trial and noticed a large underrepresentation of female patients within all arms of the study total female patients Another example of this is a trial withBortezomib which interacts with the ADAM17 pathway andhas been tried unsuccessfully in Phase II clinical trials in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic patientswith GC71 As with the Lapatinib trial this one had an overrepresentation of male patients  compared to femalepatients  A common occurrence within many of theGC clinical trials is combination of new therapies with paclitaxel or some type of Taxol We have found the female cohortto have an abundance of druggable targets interact with paclitaxel including EPB41L4B and CAPN9 Table  but largelythis demographic is underrepresented within clinical trial studies It is clear that based on the molecular profile of femalepatients with GC this issue demands further investigationMale Patients With GC May Benefit From HormoneInhibiting TherapiesAs we have previously mentioned the male cohort has anopposite molecular profile compared to the female cohort withWhen screening for actionable drug targets we limited thescope of our analysis to agonists due to the substantial geneticdownregulation already occurring naturally and notion thatmale patients with GC have an abundance of tumor suppressorlike genes In doing so we have found direct druggable targetssuch as SSTR1 and GPT Table  GPT is a gene that encodesthe alanine aminotransaminase  protein and catalyzes thereversible transamination between alanine and 2oxoglutaratewithin the tricarboxylic acid TCA cycle to generate pyruvatea TCA

regress  They  are  aesthetically  disfiguring  can cause pain itching discomfort as well as psychological stress often affecting quality of life Many treatment modalities including surgical and nonsurgical have been explored and have been reported to be beneficial however none have been absolutely satisfactory or optimal for the treatment of all keloid subtypes to date This  poses  a  major  challenge  to  clinicians  Often  a  combinational  therapeutic  approach  appears  to  offer the best results with higher patient satisfaction compared to monotherapy The aetiopathogenesis of keloids

Healinginfluence  in  keloid  aetiology9  Although  no  one specific gene has been associated with the development of keloids a number of genes and gene loci have been identified610 Genomewide association studies and admixture mapping studies have identified singlenucleotide polymorphisms across certain loci genetically linked to keloid development including  the  NEDD4  gene  which  encodes  E3 ubiquitin  ligase  enzyme  and  the  myosin  genes MY01E and MYO7A10� Studies have also reported the involvement of several human leucocyte antigen HLA alleles p53 bcl2 and fas genes1014� Furthermore  rare  genetic  disorders  have  been reported  to  present  with  spontaneous  keloids including Dubowitz syndrome Bethlem myopathy RubinsteinTaybi  syndrome  Noonan  syndrome Geominne  syndrome  and  others1017  These  lines of evidence suggest that genetic factors play a role on keloid predispositionPathophysiology of keloidsKeloid  pathology  is  complex  involving  both genetic and environmental factors Keloids form as a result of abnormal wound healing and excessive dermal fibrosis Development of keloids has been linked to overproliferation and reduced apoptosis of dermal fibroblasts overproduction of collagen fibres and other extracellular matrix ECM components as well as abnormal ECM production and remodelling1  Various  cytokines  growth  factors and proteolytic enzymes have been implicated in the  formation  of  keloids  including  transforming growth factor TGF epidermal growth factor EGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF plateletderived growth factor PDGF connective tissue  growth  factor  CTGF  tumour  necrosis factorα  TNFα insulinlike  growth  factor1  IGF1 fibroblast growth factor FGF interleukin6  IL6  and  matrix  metalloproteinases MMPs31418  Furthermore  signalling  pathways such as Tolllike receptor signalling SMAD signalling and fibronectin have been reported to be associated with keloid development1819Histopathology of keloidsHistologically keloids comprise an abundance of unordered  dermal  collagen  and  vasculature  with high  inflammatorycell  infiltrate  and  overactive mesenchymal  cells1415  In  addition  to  collagen elastin  fibronectin  and  proteoglycans  are  deposited in excess amounts in keloid scars9 Collagen creates  frequent  crosslinks  in  ordinary  wounds whereas collagen is irregularly anised in keloids forming nodules in the dermis20 During normal Figure   Earlobe keloids as a consequence of ear piercingarise from skin trauma or inflammation and may develop  years  after  the  initial  insult  and  rarely regress2 The scar tissue extends beyond the original wound site and can be disfiguring and cause psychosocial  issues  impairing  quality  of  life3  In addition  patients  may  present  with  symptoms such as burning pain pruritus movement limitation and hyperaesthesia2AetiologyThe  aetiology  of  keloids  is  still  poorly  understood The most common regions of the skin for keloids include upper arms skin overlying joints chest shoulders and head�neck regions particularly  the  ear  lobes  Figure    The  anatomical location of a keloid appears to alter its morphological characteristics Some keloids can develop spontaneously  however  most  occur  years  after local trauma and other events including inflammation surgery burns elective cosmesis foreign body reactions acne insect bites vaccinations or mechanical force45Epidemiology and keloid geneticsThe incidence of keloids is highest among darkerpigmented  persons  of  African  Asian  and Hispanic  descent  and  is  estimated  to  be  in  the range  of  �  Males  and  females  have  an equal risk of developing keloids6 although incidence  is  slightly  increased  in  females  likely attributable to them having more cosmetic procedures  like  ear  piercing7  Persons  aged  � years  are  also  at  a  higher  risk  of  developing keloids  Additional  risk  factors  include  having blood  type  A  hyperIgE  and  hormonal  peaks during pregnancy or puberty8Familial  keloid  case  studies  and  twin  studies support  the  notion  that  genetic  factors  have  an 0cOjeh  for the treatment of keloids2627 Intralesional TAC injections have been shown to reduce scar volume and height improve scar pliability and diminish associated scar pain and itching8 as well as prevent recurrence3  Corticosteroids  have  antiinflammatory  and  antimitotic  properties1  Several  other mechanisms  have  been  reported  by  which  corticosteroids reduce keloid scar including inhibition of  fibroblast  growth  attenuation  of  procollagen and  glycosaminoglycan  synthesis  reduction  of endothelial  budding  and  enhancement  of  collagen  and  fibroblast  degeneration2829  Corticos teroids  inhibit  TGF1  expression  and  induce apoptosis in fibroblasts inhibit VEGF and alphaglobulins which are involved in the wound healing  process28�  VEGF  which  promotes angiogenesis was reported to be highly expressed in  keloid  fibroblasts  compared  to  controls  but exogenous  addition  of  the  glucocorticoid  dexamethasone  suppressed  its  expression  in  vitro32 Furthermore VEGF expression was overexpressed in  keloid  tissue  which  later  reduced  following intralesional TAC injections in vivo33TAC  is  typically  administered  at  intervals  of �  weeks  until  pruritic  and  painassociated symptoms  diminish  and  the  scar  flattens34  The dose  of  TAC  is  in  the  range  of  �  mgmL depending  on  the  size  and  anatomical  location of the lesion and the age of the patient34 TAC is used either alone as a monotherapy or in combination  with  other  treatment  modalities13  The response  rates  to  corticosteroid  injections  vary clinically  with  regression  rates  in  the  range  of �  reported  after  one  year  and  recurrence  rates  in  the  range  of  �  reported after  five  years3  Combined  therapy  comprising surgical excision followed by TAC treatment also varied  with  reported  recurrence  rates  in  the range  of  �  Previous  clinical  studies where TAC was used alone reported efficacy and good  clinical  outcome  with  this  treatment  including reduced keloid height length width related pruritus and erythema and improved pliability3637  A  recent  randomised  parallelgroup study  that  compared  the  role  of  intralesional TAC  fractional  CO2  laser  or  intralesional  verapamil  in  the  treatment  of  keloid  in    patients showed reduction in scar height vascularity and pliability in all three groups using the Vancouver Scar Scale score however pigmentation was not completely resolved with any of the treatments The  response  was  fastest  with  TAC  followed  by verapamil and laser and this was statistically significant38 However intralesional TAC in combination with other treatment modalities such as 5fluorouracil  5FU  pulsed  dye  laser  PDL surgery  interferon  IFNα2b  verapamil  and

licaruoroulf UFsracS lacigruS 0c Scars Burns  HealingA variety of methods can be used for the surgical removal of keloids depending on the size of the  keloid  anatomical  location  skin  type  and age of patient52 These include linear closure and flap  coverage  excision  with  grafting  Wplasty and  Zplasty53  To  reduce  risk  of  keloid  recurrence  the  surgeon  performing  the  excision should establish tensionfree wound closure As a general  rule  closure  of  the  wound  should  be accomplished with minimal tension and sutures leaving everted wound borders Zplasties threelayered  sutures  subcutaneousfascial  tensile reduction  sutures  or  local  ﬂap  surgery  can  be employed  on  a  casebycase  basis5455  The  final outcome of the scar is often positively correlated with  the  experience  of  the  operating  surgeon and  technique  utilised  as  well  as  the  patients� active participation in their wound care52Siliconebased productsSince  the  1980s  siliconebased  products  have been used in the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic  scars  with  silicone  gel  or  silicone  gel sheeting  considered  as  firstline  therapy  for minor keloids and hypertrophic scars2635 There are  various  other  forms  of  silicone  including creams sprays gel cushion and liquid24 The precise mechanism of action of silicone products is not fully understood but it is proposed that they enhance hydration and create an occlusive environment53 which influences fibroblast regulation and  decreases  collagen  synthesis56  Silicone  gel sheeting  has  been  shown  to  have  minimal  side effects  including  local  irritation  which  can  be resolved  quickly24  Studies  have  shown  that  the beneficial  effects  of  silicone  gel  sheets  include pain reduction tenderness and pruritus and flattening the keloid57 The silicone gel sheeting is recommended to be worn from two weeks after primary  wound  treatment  for  �  h  for  � months58Studies have demonstrated an improvement of up to  in keloid scars after using silicone gel  sheeting35  and  a  decrease  in  the  incidence rates  of  keloids  and  hypertrophic  scars  after  surgery59  In  addition  controlled  studies  have reported the clinical effectiveness of silicone gel and silicone gel sheeting in the prevention and treatment of keloids3558 However a recent metaanalysis  review60  and  Cochrane  review61  found that even though studies published data in support of the efficacy of silicone gel sheeting in the treatment  and  prevention  of  keloid  and  hypertrophic  scarring  they  provided  weak  evidence and  were  of  poor  quality60�  Therefore  given Figure   Auricular keloid surgical excision used as monotherapy Auricular keloid before a and after b surgical excisonsurgery all yielded significant improvements compared to treatment with TAC monotherapy339�Intralesional  steroid  injections  can  cause  several  adverse  side  effects  such  as  telangiectasis atrophy steroid acne pigmentary changes necrosis ulcerations and systemic side effects3 There is also  significant  pain  associated  with  intradermal corticosteroid injections that can be reduced when local anaesthetic lidocaine is administered to control the pain44 Furthermore the side effects have been reported to diminish when intralesional TAC is used in combination with 5FU45Surgical excisionSurgical excision is a traditional method of removing keloids Figure  However excision creates a new wound and can result in a similar or larger keloid47  Therefore  surgical  excision  is  not  recommended as a monotherapy as it results in high recurrence  rates  in  the  range  of  � For better postoperative surgical outcomes surgical excision is often combined with other forms of treatment  including  radiotherapy  intralesional corticosteroid  injections  IFN  injection  bleomycin cryotherapy pressure therapy and silicone gel or sheeting82649 Successful use of dermal substitutes and epidermal skin grafting with keloid excision has also been reported50 A recent case series study  in  which    patients  with  anterior  chest wall keloids were given a treatment protocol consisting  of  complete  excision  Zplasty  postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and postsurgical wound selfmanagement  reported  excellent  outcomes with a recurrence rate of only  The use of steroid tape and injections helped to resolve the recurrence of keloids51 0cOjeh  the  lack  of  substantial  evidence  welldesigned clinical trials and studies are required to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of siliconebased products in preventing and treating keloidsPressure therapyPressure therapy has been used to treat and manage keloids and hypertrophic scars for decades3563 It has been routinely employed as firstline treatment  in  the  treatment  of  hypertrophic  scarring resulting  from  burns64  The  underlying  mechanisms of action of compression techniques remain unclear however several hypotheses exist some of which include increased pressure to the scar surface  reduces  perfusion  and  decreased  oxygen  to the location of injury reduces collagen synthesis It is  also  thought  that  pressure  increases  apoptosis reduces  scar  hydration  stabilising  mast  cells  and decreases angiogenesis165 The application of pressure can be achieved using a variety of materials such as adhesive plaster moulds pressure earrings and  customfitted  splints16  which  have  improved scar cosmesis and rates of keloid recurrence66� A continuous  pressure  of  �  mmHg  preferably at the lower range soon after wound reepithelialisation for � h per day for   months is recommended166869 The efficacy of pressure therapy depends mainly on the anatomical location of the scar with trunk and limb areas being more appropriate  sites  for  pressure  therapy  In  addition  a pressure garment is predominantly used for auricular  keloids  where  pressure  clips  are  commonly utilised  after  surgery6670  As  an  adjuvant  therapy this form of pressure garment has also been successfully  used  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of keloids6667 In contrast a metaanalysis review that analysed  the  effectiveness  of  pressure  garment therapy  for  the  prevention  of  abnormal  scarring after  burn  injury  was  unable  to  demonstrate  any beneficial effects of pressure garment therapy on prevention  or  treatment  of  abnormal  scarring59 Notwithstanding success rates of pressure therapy are contingent upon patient compliance69 which can sometimes be low due to discomfort Overall pressure therapy is tolerated better and is devoid of the pain often associated with intralesional therapies and hence can be considered as a good adjuvant therapy for keloid scarsRadiotherapyIn  the treatment of keloids using superficial Xray irradiation was first described71 Since then it has been used less frequently as a monotherapy and more widely as an effective adjunct treatment after surgical excision72� with success rates in the range  of  �  and  recurrence  rates  of about  Radioactive skin patches have also been used in combination with other treatment modalities  for  keloids7879  Radiotherapy  is  most commonly used � h after surgical excision7480 and acts by suppressing angiogenesis and inhibiting ﬁbroblast activity1 Decreased fibroblast proliferation  induced  cell  senescence  and  apoptosis leading to reduction in collagen production and suppression  of  keloid  development  have  also been reported81�Different  radiotherapy  modalities  have been  used  after  surgical  excision  including electron  beam  radiotherapy  brachytherapy superﬁcial and orthovoltage radiotherapy with varying  degrees  of  success84  Mankowski  et a0 al conducted  a  literature  review  of    studies  to compare  the  clinical  outcome  of  different forms of radiation treatment used for the management of keloids77 The metaanalysis demonstrated  that  radiation  used  as  monotherapy yielded higher rates of recurrence  compared  to  combinational  therapy  with  postsurgery excision  Comparison between the different  radiationbased  treatments  revealed that the lowest rate of recurrence was observed with  brachytherapy    followed  jointly  by Xray    and  electron  beam    The authors  also  reported  that  the  rate  of  recurrence was dependent on anatomical site of the keloid  with  chest  keloids  having  the  highest recurrence rate73The  adverse  effects  of  radiotherapy  often linked  with  dose  of  radiation  used  can  be grouped into acute skin reactions and late complications Acute reactions arise as early as seven days after keloid treatment and include oedema necrosis  ulceration  desquamation  erythema and  pigmentary  changes  with  the  latter  two being  the  most  common  Late  complications which include changes in pigment atrophy telangiectasis  and  alopecia  may  present  several weeks after radiotherapy Emollient and steroid ointment used after radiotherapy can help alleviate the side effects19 A recommended radiation dose   Gy over several sessions can also minimise  adverse  effects1980  Radiotherapy  carries  a risk of malignancy8586 Therefore caution should be used in radiationvulnerable sites such as the head  neck  thyroid  and  breast  and  in  patients aged   years2 Protecting fragile ans and selecting  the  most  appropriate  sitedependent dose protocol can help minimise further complications of radiotherapy87 0c Scars Burns  HealingCryotherapyCryotherapy is a lowtemperature treatment that causes  vascular  damage  resulting in  tissue  necrosis88 It has been used to treat keloids as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment  methods  such  as  intralesional  steroid  injections89  Various  delivery  methods  used  for cryotherapy include spray and contact probes or the intralesionalneedle  cryoprobe  method Compared to contact and spray methods intralesionalneedle  cryoprobe  was  found  to  be  the most effective method in treating keloid scars90 Positive outcomes were observed in a number of studies  that  used  liquid  nitrogen  and  cryotherapy to treat keloids with success rates in the range of ��External  cryotherapy  has  been  associated with several side effects including hypopigmentation  blistering  pain  delayed  healing  and  infection9093 Moreover larger keloids have been shown to need multiple cryotherapy sessions9093 To  minimise  side  effects  intralesional  cryotherapy was introduced and there are now a number of  nitrogenbased  cryodevices  that  have  been described for the treatment of keloid scars with two  commercially  available  a  liquid  nitrogenbased device88 and an argon gasbased device94 The  intralesional  cryotherapy  was  designed  to overcome the hypopigmentation seen mostly in darkskinned individuals with external cryotherapy It works by destroying the core of the keloid sparing the surface epithelial cells including melanocytes9596  As  a  result  it  enhances  volume decrease  while  minimising  the  risk  of  hypopigmentation and other surface reactions90 A recent comprehensive  review  based  on  the  preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalysis was performed to investigate the efficacy of  intralesional  cryotherapy  on  keloid  scars90 The review of eight studies that met the inclusion criteria  revealed  that  average  scar  volume decreased  in  the  range  of  �  but  complete eradication of the scar on average was lacking Recurrence of keloid scars was in the range of  �  The  authors  also  reported  that patients�  complaints  of  pain  and  pruritus  was considerably  reduced  however  hypopigmentation was seen mostly in Fitzpatrick � skin type patients after treatment90Laser therapyLaser  therapy  for  keloid  treatment  was  introduced in the 1980s97 Since then different systems have been used for the treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars4898 These lasers target skin chromophores like haemoglobin and melanin based on the principle of selective photothermolysis99  Lasers  can  be  classified  as ablative  and  nonablative  The  most  common ablative  lasers  include  the  2940nm  erbiumdoped  yttrium  aluminium  garnet  ErYAG laser and the 10600nm carbon dioxide CO2 laser These emit a laser beam that is absorbed by  water  in  the  skin  leading  to  local  tissue destruction  and  reduction  of  lesion  volume3 Common  examples  of  nonablative lasers include 585nm or 595nm PDLs 1064nm neodymiumdopedyttriumaluminiumgarnet NdYAG neodymiumdopedvanadate  NdVan  laser  and    nm Qswitched  NdYAG  laser  with  low  fluence100 These lasers induce thermal injury to the scar�s microvasculature  leading  to  thrombosis  and ischaemia  which  result  in  collagen  denaturation and collagen fibre realignment101�532nm laser Laser  therapy  requires  several  treatments  at intervals of � weeks depending on scar type and type  of  laser  used98104  with  possible  side  effects including itching pigmentary changes blister formation  and  postoperative  purpura98  The  use  of the  nonfractional  vascular  �  nm  PDL  in the  treatment  of  keloid  and  hypertrophic  scars has been welldocumented105� and has response rates in the range of � PDL monotherapy has been shown to be effective108110 as well as CO2 laser monotherapy38111112 In a clinical study where  patients with moderate to severe keloids were  treated  with  highenergy  pulsed  CO2  laser the  treatment  was  efficacious  and  welltolerated with minimal side effects112 In other studies where CO2 laser ablation was compared with other forms of treatment CO2 laser was as efficient as the other forms38111 It must be noted however that these studies are small and randomised controlled studies are lacking98Laser therapy such as PDL CO2 and NdYAG have  been  associated  with  a  high  rate  of  recurrence at � months111113� However optimal results  can  be  achieved  with  combination  treatment  especially  with  intralesional  TAC  injections116�  Kumar  and  coworkers  conducted  a cohort  study  on    patients  with  keloids  previously treated with an NdYAG laser and reported complete scar resolution and flattening in seven patients  only  when  intralesional  TAC  was  used after  laser  therapy41  Moreover  combined  therapy  with  PDL  and  TAC119  and  PDL  TAC  and 5FU36  were  shown  to  produce  better  clinical results In a recent study that evaluated and compared  the  efficacy  of  combination  therapy  of 0cOjeh  scars statistically fractional CO2 laser and intralesional TAC injection or TAC injection

laser  and  IFNα2b  injections given to patients with auricular keloids resulted in no recurrence in  of patients three years after treatment121 Laser therapy can also be combined  with  other  laser  treatment  topical  corticosteroids  and  cyanoacrylate  glue98  and  have shown  promising  results  however  larger  controlled clinical studies are needed to further evaluate their efficacy and safetyRecently  lasers  are  also  being  explored  as tools for assisted drug delivery Kraeva et a0al proposed an alternative technique of corticosteroid administration  of  laserassisted  drug  delivery  of topical TAC This was shown to be effective when used  on  a  keloid  on  the  posterior  scalp  of  a patient after each CO2 laser session122 More efficient  intraepidermal  drug  delivery  options  are also being investigated Singhal et a0al developed TACcontaining  polymeric  microps  that were prepared using a cryomilling technique for freezing fracture After ablation with a fractional ErYAG laser these microps can be deposited in cutaneous micropores and provide highdose intraepidermal  reservoir  systems  with minimal transdermal permeation leading to sustained and targeted local drug delivery123It must be noted that one of the biggest limitations in studies available at present is the lack of  histological  definition  between  keloid  and hypertrophic scars so

predominantly  involve established virological procedures such as nucleic acid hybridization techniques reversetranscriptase PCR [RTPCR] and recombinase  polymerase  amplification  RPA  as  well  as immunologic  approaches like  antibody  assays  Each approach  boasts  unique  strengths  and  weaknesses  For instance while RTPCR demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity  its  capabilities  have  been  severely  limited  for practical reasons during this current pandemic due to global shortages of skilled personnel reagents and equipment and a processing time of up to  days By contrast immunologic tests such as antibody assays are rapid and require minimal equipment  but  they  have  limited  utility  in  the  context  of acute diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infections This is because it can take several days to weeks following symptom onset for a patient to mount a detectable antibody response6Immunological tools in research include enzymelinked immunosorbent  assays  ELISAs  flow  cytometry  and mass cytometry CyTOF Imaging techniques for pathological analyses include conventional approaches such as hematoxylin�eosin HE staining immunohistochemical IHC  staining  or  transmission  electron  microscopy TEM and RNAscope Each of these methods is used to examine the pathophysiology underlying COVID19 from a different perspective each with their own advantages and disadvantages  For  example  it  has  been  established  that the entry of SARSCoV2 intro cells depends on the binding of viral proteins with the human receptor angiotensinconverting  enzyme    ACE2  receptors7  Additionally evidence  shows  that  the  type  II  transmembrane  protease TMPRSS2 is also essential for viral entry by priming the viral spike protein for binding to ACE28 Therefore considerable  research  efforts  employing  different  techniques have  been  directed  at  mapping  the  distribution  of ACE2 and  TMPRSS2  in  tissues  and  their  relationship  to  the observed manifestations of disease Together the combination of these approaches has advanced our understanding of COVID19In  this  review  we  discuss  the  current  approaches  in COVID19 diagnosis and research with a focus on findings from  virological  and  pathological  imaging  methods  We also  discuss  immunological  methods  which  are  increasingly  recognized  as  an  integral  component  of  the  disease processDiagnosticsThe most common symptoms of COVID19 at initial presentation  are  nonspecific  and  include  a  high  fever  a  new and  persistent  cough  and  fatigue910  Due  to  similarities between the clinical characteristics of COVID19 and many other respiratory illnesses the accurate and early detection of infection is pivotal for outbreak control Any delays in diagnosis are increasingly measured in lives lostAccording to the World Health anization WHO the immediate goal for research into COVID19 diagnostics is the  development  of  RNA  assays  antibody  and  antigen assays  and  pointofcare  detection11  The  intermediateterm priority would be their integration into multiplex diagnostic  platforms  while  the  longterm  goal  would  be  the investigation of prognostic markersIn this section we summarize the current and emerging diagnostic  tools  for  SARSCoV2  through  the  lens  of immunologyLabBased TestsRTPCR  Molecular  Testing  The  detection  of  viral  nucleic acids by RTPCR is the primary method used to confirm a suspected  case  of  COVID19  RTPCR  and  other  nucleic acid hybridization techniques are an integral part of virology and are applied in a broad range of settings including screening  diagnosis  informing  medical  and  therapeutic decisions and assessing cure rates from therapy12 Chinese officials released the genomic sequence of SARSCoV2 to public databases early in the course of the outbreak13 and the WHO has since published seven protocols for RTPCRbased diagnostics Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of RTPCR it is regarded as the �gold standard� for virus detection14 There are two essential steps in the process  viral RNA extraction and  PCR amplification and  probebased  detection  Multiple  largescale  highthroughput  instruments  are  available  for  automating  both steps such as the Roche Cobas  system which has an advertised throughput of  tests per  hours15However RTPCRbased testing is costly and timeconsuming requiring up to  days using centralized laboratory equipment and skilled personnel furthermore global supply  chain  challenges  have  led  to  significant  shortages  of essential reagents Lastly falsenegative results due to low sample  volumes  variable  sampling  techniques  and  sampling  locations  sample  degradation  during  transportation andor improper nucleic acid extraction are a concern16� In  addition  the  differences  in  detectable  viral  material  in different sampling locations eg nasopharyngeal vs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [BALF] vs rectal samples might also  explain  the  falsepositive  RTPCR  results  on  repeat testing  in  �recovered�  COVID19  patients  Indeed  one postmortem case study revealed residual virus in lung tissue despite  consecutive  negative  results  on  PCR  testing  from nasopharyngeal  swabs19  Separately  Winichakoon  et  al outlined a case of repeatedly negative nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal  swabs  in  a  clinically  deteriorating  patient where only a BALF PCR test returned positive20Given the high expression of ACE2 on alveolar epithelial cells and negative expression on nasal oral and nasopharynx  0cTan et al cells21  it  would  be  prudent  to  perform  bronchoalveolar lavage  on  patients  to  rule  out  falsenegative  results  from swabs of upper respiratory tract samples20LabBased  Immunological  Assays  In  contrast  to  RTPCR techniques  that  detect  viral  nucleic  acids  serological  and immunological  assays  aim  to  detect  antibodies  against SARSCoV2 or antigenic proteins in infected individuals Neutralization assays are considered the gold standard for assessing  neutralizing  protective  antibodies22  however these  assays  require  specialized  biosafety  level    BSL3 facilities  and  still  take  several  days  to  complete Another type of labbased antibody assay is the traditional ELISA which  detects  all  binding  antibodies  The  four  principal types of ELISA are direct indirect competitive and sandwich  ELISA  the  indirect  ELISA  is  the  most  common method  for  determining  antibody  concentrations  ELISAs have  good  concordance  with  neutralization  assays  for  the detection of antibody responses in SARSCoV223 Unfortunately  both  methods  require  skilled  operators  and  are limited by low throughput due to the absence of fully automated systemsSerological  diagnostics  offer  several  advantages  Re quirements  for  specimen  quality  are  comparatively  less stringent  than  for  nucleic  acid  tests  as  the  antibodies  are uniformly  distributed  in  the  serum24  Consequently  sampling  location  concerns  do  not  apply  here  Furthermore good correlation between IgG ELISAs performed on both conventional serum samples and plasma samples have been reported25 of which the latter may be conveniently obtained from residual blood submitted for other routine laboratory testsOne pitfall of antibody assays is their limited utility early in the course of any infection Sparse data are available with regard to the antibody responses produced by patients with COVID19 It seems that SARSCoV2 IgM is detectable at a  median  of    days  after  symptom  onset  while  IgG  is detectable  after    days26  with  the  seroconversion  rate approaching    by  day    An  Italian  research  group noted  that  the  performance  of  a  commercial  VivaDiag COVID19 IgMIgG test was very poor with a sensitivity of only  and a negative predictive value of  in a cohort of suspected COVID19 patients in the emergency room setting27 As such we believe that for now RTPCR testing  is  likely  more  appropriate  for  diagnosing  acute COVID19Notably  a  longitudinal  study  examining  the  IgGIgM profiles  of    patients  found  that  seroconversion  for  IgG and IgM occurred in no specific chronological order with a median  of    days  after  symptom  onset28  all  patients achieved  seroconversion  by  day    Consequently  the detection of both IgG and IgM simultaneously rather than one antibody alone would be idealAnother  concern  surrounding  serologic  diagnostics  is the production of falsepositive results from crossreactivity due to the high prevalence of the four endemic human coronaviruses  in  the  human  population  In  SARSCoV2 the spike S protein which includes two regions S1 and S2  and  the  nucleocapsid  N  protein  NP  are  the  major immunogens29 and therefore most diagnostics rely on the detection  of  antibodies  specific  for  these  antigens  One work  suggests  that  of  the  possible  targets  the  S1  subunit antigen is more specific than either the whole S antigen or the N antigen for detecting SARSCoV2 antibodies with no crossreactivity to other coronaviruses except for SARSCoV23  Given  that  only    SARSCoV  infections  were recorded worldwide30 the risk of false positives from this crossreactivity  is  miniscule  However  NP  ELISAs  are more sensitive than S1 in detecting antibodies in those with a mild infection23 Importantly as in SARSCoV most of the neutralizing antibodies are directed against the S protein31  of  which  S1  contains  a  receptorbinding  domain RBD responsible for making contact with ACE2 to facilitate  viral  entry7  Thus  theoretically  only  diagnostics  that detect S1specific antibodies are suitable to infer immunity to  COVID19  this  fact  is  corroborated  by  evidence  that antiS RBD but not antiNP IgG levels correlated with neutralizing antibody titers in sera from a cohort of  recovered patients32 The number of commercial antibody assays is  growing  detecting  either  antiNP  antibodies  antiS1S antibodies  or  both  there  is  also  large  variation  in  their claimed sensitivities and specificities33 Based on the available evidence an ideal serological assay would be a combined test that simultaneously detects both antibodies to NP and S1 antigens assessment of antiNP antibodies has good sensitivity and would be best suited for supporting the diagnosis  of  infection  while  the  additional  antiS1  antibody assay would allow for the determination of immunityRapid TestsPointofCare RTPCR Tests  A small number of commercial pointofcare tests utilizing RTPCR have been developed These typically involve the same methodology as conventional RTPCR but implemented with automated and portable  benchtopsized  instruments  that  can  be  operated closer  to  patient  care  settings  than  a  centralized  laboratory  A  prominent  example  is  Cepheid�s  Xpert  Xpress SARSCoV2 run on the Gene Xpert platform This apparatus can provide a result within  min Others include the MesaBioTech Accula Test and MicrosensDx RapiPrep COVID19 Despite displaying good sensitivity and specificity  these  instruments  are  generally  limited  by  a  very low  throughput  of  only  one  to  four  tests  per  run  per machine34 and as such are only suited to small laboratories or clinics 0c SLAS Technology  Figure   Loopmediated isothermal amplification LAMP A LAMP begins when the forward inner primer FIP binds to the A2C region

immunoassays LFIAs Fig  and chemiluminescent immunoassays CLIAs Fig  offer the benefits of rapid diagnostic testing at a low cost These assays do not require specialized equipment or expertise35 and are thus excellent candidates for  pointofcare  testing  or  deployment  on  a  large  scale This an area of intense interest with governments worldwide  aiming  to  order  millions  of  tests  to  inform  policy makers about attack rates in their populations36 LFIAs are predominantly  singleuse  kits  designed  for  pointofcare use while CLIAs are fully automated analyzers that permit very high testing throughputUnfortunately  these  tests  do  not  quantify  the  antibody titers  and  the  performance  of  LFIAs  has  been  called  into question one evaluation of nine commercial LFIAs reported a sensitivity ranging from only  to  versus RTPCR and    to    versus  ELISA37  Meanwhile  the  performance of CLIAs is superior with good sensitivity and specificity levels similar to those of ELISA38 Otherwise these tests  share  the  same  advantages  and  drawbacks  as  the  0cTan et al Table   Summary of Diagnostic Approaches for COVID19CategoryType of TestTypical Test Result

Assays  An alternative approach to immunological assays is to directly detect SARSCoV2 viral antigens Several  commercial  pointofcare  antigen  tests  are  available but their performance remains to be evaluated These tests may be suitable for making an early diagnosis and are deployable as pointofcare assays However they face the same  sampling  limitations  as  RTPCR  and  are  hypothetically hampered by limited sensitivity due to the omission of  an  amplification  process  unlike  nucleic  acid  testing For  example  one  multicenter  study  evaluating  the  Corisbio COVID19 Ag RespiStrip a lateral flow assay for the SARSCoV2 NP reported a test sensitivity of only Rapid  NonPCR  Molecular  Testing  Nucleic  acid  testing using nonPCR methods is an emerging approach for rapid diagnostics  and  several  assays  have  received  Food  and Drug Administration FDA emergency use authorization which  facilitates  the  distribution  of  unapproved  medical products or the offlabel use of approved medical products  when  certain  criteria  are  met  These  methods  share high sensitivity and specificity on par with RTPCR but with  the  principal  advantages  of  more  rapid  testing  at  a lower cost40�LAMP Fig  is one such novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that does not require a thermal cycler One example is the ID NOW COVID19 test from Abbott Diagnostics which can deliver results in just  min43 and uses  a  lightweight  portable  instrument  allowing  onsite testing of swab samples However it has a limited throughput of only one sample per runThe CRISPR enzymes Cas12 and Cas13 have also been adapted  for  rapid  nucleic  acid  sensing    Fig    The DETECTR  assay  by  Mammoth  Biosciences45  as  well  as the  SHERLOCK  assay  by  Sherlock  Biosciences46  potentially offers sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of RTPCR but can be completed in  h However these approaches are still in the early stages of commercialization and current applications are available only as test kits to be run in labs while pointofcare versions exist as proofofconcept demonstrations47 Nonetheless their inherent characteristics hold great potential for diagnosis in the futurePrognostication of DiseaseProfiling  of  Genetic  Susceptibility  Work  is  in  progress  to ascertain the possible genetic basis for

SARSCoV2  have  been  associated  with  more severe  disease2350  similar  to  previous  studies  in  Middle East  respiratory  syndrome  MERS�CoV51  ELISA  has been used to provide a quantitative measurement of serum and  plasma  IgM  and  IgG  antibodies  By  monitoring  the kinetics of IgM and IgG antibodies specific to the N and S proteins on SARSCoV2 it was found that intensive care unit ICU patients had a significantly lower level of SIgG within    weeks  of  symptom  onset  but  a  higher  level  of NIgG antibodies compared with nonICU patients52 This finding highlights the possible utility of SIgG and NIgG as a prognostic tool for COVID19 patientsThe Ddimer level which consists of crosslinked fibrin degradation products that reflect ongoing blood clot formation  and  breakdown  activity  in  the  body  is  another  proposed  prognostic  marker  Modern  commercial  assays  for Ddimers are based on monoclonal antibodies employing either ELISA or microlatex agglutination assays53 Reports have emerged that elevated Ddimer levels suggestive of a hypercoagulable state are associated with drastically worse outcomes A Chinese group reported that Ddimer levels of ��  �gmL  on  admission  were  associated  with  a   times  increased  mortality  relative  to  Ddimer  levels  of   �gmL in a cohort of  COVID19 patients54 This finding of Ddimer levels as a negative prognostic marker was also noted in other studies conducted in China455 and the Netherlands56Similarly  interleukin  IL6  a  key  component  of  the cytokine release syndrome is another marker measured by ELISA  and  has  been  described  to  independently  predict adverse outcomes in COVID195758 Tumor necrosis factor alpha  TNFα  another  important  proinflammatory  cytokine  has  also  been  found  to  be  strongly  correlated  with Figure   Chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay CLIA SARSCoV2 antigens will capture IgM and IgG antibodies from the sample serum Secondary antibodies that are conjugated with horseradish peroxidase HRP bind to the captured primary IgM and IgG antibodies and react with a chemiluminescent substrate to generate a strong chemiluminescent signal that is measured in terms of relative light units RLUEast  Asian  populations  but  reported  no  direct  evidence supporting  the  existence  of  S  proteinbindingresistant ACE2 mutants48 out of  identified protein altering variants Separately Stawiski et al analyzed ACE2 polymorphisms  within  a  much  larger  population  dataset  spanning more than  population groups across the world and performed structural predictions to identify variants that might confer protection or rather increase susceptibility to SARSCoV2 S protein binding49 Out of a total of  identified proteinaltering ACE2 variants  variants were predicted to increase susceptibility while  variants were speculated to  confer  protection  however  the  degree  of  changes  in receptor�virus binding interactions for each structural variant was not quantified These findings represent significant developments in our understanding of population risk profiles for COVID19 and future coronavirus infections 0cTan et al endan  damage  and  mortality  even  after  adjusting  for disease severity scores59 Gao et al examined both IL6 and Ddimer levels they proposed a panel comprising tandem testing of these two markers which produced a sensitivity of    and  specificity  of    in  early  prediction  of severe COVID1958 Elevated troponin levels a marker of myocardial  injury  measured  with  ELISA  immunoassays also strongly predict progression to death in patients with severe illness60 These results suggest that multiplex cytokine and serum marker profiling will be a powerful tool in stratifying  patients  that  may  guide  clinical  decisions  and resource allocationSummary  In sum rapid progress has been made in diagnostics for COVID19 Yet the race against time continues for researchers and biotechnology firms to develop rapid costeffective  and  reliable  test  kits  that  can  be  deployed on a large scale At the time of writing labbased RTPCR testing  has  been  the  dominant  diagnostic  approach  but alternative molecular approaches like isothermal amplification and CRISPR which have clear advantages are on the horizon Immunological tests such as CLIA and LFIA will become increasingly important because of the urgent need for  pointofcare  diagnostics  for  mass  testing  of  infected asymptomatic individuals and their close contacts and will be  valuable  in  complementing  molecular  approaches  for confirming  infection  Furthermore  immunological  assays will  be  in  great  demand  by  policy  makers  worldwide  for the  assessment  of  immunity  to  COVID19  However  the performance of these serological tests varies significantly particularly  their  degree  of  sensitivity  and  specificity  we believe that caution must be taken in the interpretation of these tests Detailed evaluation of the reliability of serological tests will be a key area for future research Lastly given the  importance  of  techniques  like  ELISA  in  prognosticating COVID19 immunological methods will undoubtedly occupy a crucial role in achieving all levels of the WHO�s short medium and longterm diagnostic goalsCOVID19 Research ToolsImmunological ApproachesCOVID19  infection  has  a  poor  prognosis  in  individuals with  comorbidities  and  abnormal  immune  functions Although  research  surrounding  COVID19  is  still  in  its infancy several studies have revealed lymphopenia and the cytokine  storm  as  underlying  mechanisms  correlating  to disease progression Here we discuss the various immunological techniques involved in assessing host immunity in COVID19 patientsELISA  As  discussed  ELISA  has  also  been  used  to  detect the  inflammatory  cytokines  implicated  in  the  cytokine storm seen in patients with severe respiratory failure due to COVID19  One  study  found  that  the  immune  dysregulation in patients with severe respiratory failure was due to a significantly  increased  production  of  IL6  and  defective lymphoid function because of an IL6mediated decrease in HLADR  expression  on  CD14  monocytes  Interestingly interferongamma  IFNγ  levels  were  below  the  detection level in these patients suggesting that T helper Th  cells are  unlikely  to  be  major  players  in  the  overinflammatory response  of  severe  patients61  A  similar  observation  was made in a separate study whereby inflammatory cytokines that mediate major immune responses such as TNFα and IL1β  were  not  significantly  elevated  in  ICU  patients62 These findings demonstrate that the immunophenotype of patients with COVID19 can vary depending on presently unclear host immune factors and the severity of their condition This  relationship  between  disease  severity  and  cytokine storm has also been highlighted in other studies that found  a  significantly  elevated  plasma  concentration  of granulocyte  colonystimulating  factor  GCSF  IP10 CCL2 and CCL3 in ICU patients compared with nonICU patients63ELISA is also being used as a companion diagnostic tool for therapeutic purposes In a study that explored the use of convalescent plasma therapy from donors as a form of treatment in severe COVID19 ELISA was used to assess the neutralizing activity of the RBDspecific IgM and IgG antibodies found in the donor convalescent plasma64 After the transfusion was complete ELISA was also used to detect IgG  IgM  and  neutralizing  antibody  titers  in  the  sera  of patients to assess the response to treatment65EnzymeLinked Immunosorbent Spot  Enzymelinked immunosorbent spot ELISPOT is a sensitive immunoassay that quantitatively measures cytokinesecreting cells at the singlecell level providing insight into immunerelated cellular activities66 Hence it is a promising tool for characterizing specific Tcell  immunity  in  COVID19  patients  By  IFNγ ELISPOT  analysis  it  was  revealed  that  convalescent COVID19  patients  had  significantly  increased  levels  of IFNγsecreting T cells when compared with healthy donors A  significant  correlation  between  neutralizing  antibody titers and NPspecific T cells was identified in these patients suggesting  that  a  combination  of  humoral  and  cellular immunity  is  integral  to  clearing  SARSCoV2  Interestingly  it  was  noted  that  in  convalescent  patients    weeks IFNγsecreting  Tcell  numbers  had postdischarge decreased suggesting that they may not be maintained for a prolonged period of time even in recovered patients67ELISPOT is also serving a vital role in vaccine development through the detection of potential Tcell epitopes in  the  S  protein  RBD  of  SARSCoV268  One  study  was able  to  harness  ELISPOT  assays  to  identify  three  Tcell epitopes that induced a strong adaptive immune response  0c SLAS Technology  postimmunization demonstrating the promise of ELISPOT assays  in  the  area  of  vaccine  development32  Recently ELISPOT has also been applied to assess the immunogenicity of newly developed vaccines One such study successfully  utilized  an  IFNγ  ELISPOT  assay  to  evaluate Tcell responses to a new SARSCoV2 vaccine in murine splenocytes and rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs The promising findings from this animal study informed the start of a phase I clinical trial with  the  same  vaccine  highlighting  the  usefulness  of ELISPOT in assessing immune responses to new vaccines and promoting vaccine development69Flow Cytometry  Unlike ELISA and ELISPOT flow cytometry determines the number of cytokinesecreting cells and has the capacity to immunophenotype based on surface and intracellular markers70 In relation to the current pandemic this technique enables the detection sorting and analysis of multiple subpopulations of immune cells specific to COVID Using flow cytometry researchers detected a cytotoxic immune  environment  in  patient  blood  samples  despite  a reduction in the overall lymphocyte population71� As part of the SARSCoV2 antiviral response peripheral lymphocytes  retain  the  capacity  to  activate  and  differentiate  into subpopulations  such  as  antibodysecreting  cells  CD3�CD19CD27hiCD38hi follicular T cells CD4CXCR5ICOSPD1  CD4 Th  cells  CD38HLADRCD4  cytotoxic T Tc cells CD38HLADRCD8 and regulatory T  Treg  cells  CD3CD4CD25CD127�  These  Tc cells harbor large amounts of cytotoxic granules while CD4 Th  cells  skewed  toward  a  proinflammatory Th1  and  Th17 phenotype727375 The overall hyperinflammation and cytotoxic environment supports the notion that a cytokine storm could be liable for the multisystemic insults in patients with severe COVID19Elicitation of antiviral Tcell responses specific to SARSCoV2 is of utmost importance to establishing viral control Many studies have demonstrated robust antiviral responses however there is no known set of markers reported to identify  SARSCoV2specific  T  cells  Collectively  most groups  have  characterized  SARSCoV2specific  T  cells based on HLADR CD38 CD69 CD25 CD44 and Ki67 expression T</td><td>5856</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td> Cabozantinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor whose targets include vascular endothelial growth factor

patients receiving cabozantinib experienced an adverse event AE but these were effectively managed with dose modification and supportive care measuresClinicians treating patients with advanced HCC can face significant challenges as many patients present with cirrhosis and comorbidities that can impact treatment tolerability Adequate assessment of liver function and management of comorbidities are

primarily in older adults [] In addition to the underlying HCC etiology older adults with HCC are likely to have additional comorbidities such as cardiovascular or pulmonary disease [] and it is not uncommon for patients with HCC to have multiple comorbidities [] Liver cirrhosis with compromised liver function and decreased hepatic reserve is a major risk factor for HCC development Other HCCrelated comorbidities include hepatitis B virushepatitis C virus infection alcoholic liver disease NASH and diabetes [] In addition metabolic syndrome characterized by hyperlipidemia and hypertension is linked to development of NAFLD which may progress to NASH cirrhosis and finally HCC [] For patients with HCC assessment of liver function is a key step in treatment decisionmaking [] Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment are predominantly excluded from clinical trials in HCC therefore treatment of these patients is complicated by a lack of prospective clinical data as well as competing comorbidities []Although the number of patients with HCC and prior an transplant is limited these patients are generally excluded from clinical trials and treatment is complicated by the need for immunosuppression TKIs may be used to treat posttransplant HCC recurrence although supporting data are limited The use of TKIs in these patients is complex so treatment decisions should involve collaboration between the oncology and transplant medicine care teams The use of sorafenib in patients receiving mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitorbased immunosuppression has been associated with an increased risk of fatal bleeding [ ] Immunotherapies are associated with an increased risk of an rejection in posttransplant patients []   Cabozantinib Clearance and a0ExposureTKIs are associated with high interpatient variability in clearance and exposure which may affect both efficacy and tolerability This variability may be due to a variety of factors including genetic background drug�drug interactions drugfood interactions and renal or hepatic impairment [] As evidenced by exposureresponse modeling patients with low clearance of cabozantinib may have higher exposure and an increased risk of developing certain AEs [ ] Awareness of these nuances may help clinicians to mitigate their effects thereby balancing efficacy with tolerability   Hepatic and a0Renal ImpairmentAccording to pharmacokinetic analyses of patients with HCC and other tumor types mild hepatic impairment is predicted to have a minimal effect on cabozantinib exposure [] therefore adjustment of the recommended 60mg starting dose is not necessary for patients with Child�Pugh A 0cliver function [ ] Data on the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib in patients with moderate ChildPugh B or severe Child�Pugh C hepatic impairment are limited [] As per the US Food and Drug Administration FDA prescribing information the starting dose of cabozantinib should be reduced to  mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment while cabozantinib is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment [] Note that the European Summary of Product Characteristics SmPC does not recommend dose adjustments for moderate hepatic impairment owing to limited data [] For patients with HCC increased exposure due to hepatic impairment should be considered if intolerable AEs develop and dose modification undertaken as recommended Fig a0 [ ] Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment owing to the potential for increased exposure although no dose adjustments are necessary Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment owing to lack of data on safety and efficacy in this population [  ]   Drug�Drug and a0Drug�Food InteractionsGiven the range of comorbidities that may exist in patients with advanced HCC it is important to review all concomitant medications for potential interactions prior to initiation of treatment with cabozantinib Certain medications and foods have been shown to modulate the pharmacokinetics of cabozantinib which may in turn impact exposure levels efficacy and risk of AEs Cabozantinib is metabolized in the liver primarily by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 CYP3A4 [] therefore CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may impact exposure examples of CYP3A4 inducersinhibitors are

purposes total CEDs ofvarious proportionsnumbers of the clay crystallites onthe SARSCoV2 spike and the interaction of the laterwith hACE2 are plotted in Fig Based on our experience we have hypothesized thatnanoclays due to their high adhesive properties couldalso act as SARSCoV2 inhibitors They can do it bystrongly associating with the spike S present on SARSCoV2 The results obtained from the molecularlevelsimulations of the interactions indicate that due to veryhigh CED between SARSCoV2 and the nanoclays ascompared to the former and hACE2 Fig  they couldinhibit SARSCoV2 from

while a zeta potential of less than  mV generally results in agglomeration Higher dispersion tendencies ZP of the clay nanops used in the study �� to ��  mV lead to higher dispersion tendency andhence in the generation of higher surface area amplifyingthe interactions with the SARSCoV2 spike Althoughbased on their ZP Namontmorillonite nanopshave hydrophilic nature they in the presence of saltsalso promote secondary adhesion mechanisms betweenhydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces [] It should alsobe noted that these clay nanops have high dispersion tendency due to their hydrophilic nature and relatively higher repulsive acidbase AB interactions Table High dispersion in turn results in the generation ofhigh surface area for increasing the attractive interactions Higher surface areas promote larger attractionsdue to the van der Waal attractions and the electrostaticforces among oppositely charged surfaces Besides although of relatively lesser degree positively chargededges of Namontmorillonite ps also get electrically attracted to the spike SThe results of the molecularlevel simulations for theinteraction of SARSCoV2 spike S with the clay crystallites Fig  also confirm the above interaction behaviors It has been observed that the sorption of the claynanops results in the formation of closely interacting strong van der Waals attraction fields These van derWaals

glycoproteins synthesized by plasma cells as part ofthe adaptive immune response to assist in the clearanceof infection from the body Antibodies aid in infectionclearance in multiple ways such as opsonization of pathogens to facilitate phagocytosis activation of the complementandneutralization of viruses and toxins When bound to theviral surface proteins antibodies prevent the entry of theviruses into the cell by preventing the attachment of viruses to their target receptor on the cell Antibody binding can occur at different sites on the surface proteinleading to various mechanisms

Purpose of Review Recognize which are the elements that predict why a person is aging faster or slower and which interventionwe can arrange to slow down the process which permits to prevent or delay the progression of multimorbidity and disabilityRecent Findings Aging is a complex process that leads to changes in all the systems of the body and all the functions of theperson however aging develops at different rates in different people and chronological age is not always consistent withbiological ageSummary Gerontologists are focused not only on finding the best theory able to explain aging but also on identifying one or moremarkers which are able to describe aging processes These biomarkers are necessary to better define the agingrelated pathologies manage multimorbidity and improve the quality of life The aim of this paper is to review the most recent evidence onaging biomarkers and the clusters related to them for personalization of treatmentsKeywords Biomarker of aging

oldest region with  of thetotal population aged  and older However the Asia andLatin America older population is growing fast with Asia�solder population almost tripling in size from  million in to

by changes that take place at different levels ofbiological systems Biological age is of course influenced bychronological age but chronological age is by itself not representative of biological age

stressors [] If any definition of aging may appear incompleteand insufficient much more difficult and complex is to findthe marker or biomarker that can identify itMany theories currently trying to explain aging processesand many biomarkers are identified to measure aging and itsevolutionary stages Theories and biomarkers are not studiedto extend life span but to guide therapeutic choices and optimize patient management and personalization of careThe purpose of this paper is not purely to list which biomarkers are able to identify the various stages of aging ratherexplain how an epiphenomenon natural and physiological isso complex [] how many factors are protagonists in its development and how many actors and characters play in maximizing its individual features taking into account social andmorbidity biomarker These factors such as frailty loss ofautonomy essential needs and comorbidities influence theaging process and are able to justify why the biological ageof a person living in a country does not correspond to the ageof another person living in a country with better sociosanitaryconditionsClinical and Biological Aging PhenotypesThe aging phenotype can be described as a complex mosaicresulting from the interaction of a variety of environmentalstochastic and genetic�epigenetic eventsstimuli impinginglifelong on our body [ ]There is no clear evidence which molecular cellular orphysiological changes are the most important drivers of theaging process andor how they influence one another [] In itsbroadest sense aging merely refers to the changes that occurduring an anisms� life span though the rate at which thesetake place varies widely [] Despite its enormous complexityinvolving combinations of these variables a small number ofbasic molecular mechanisms underpin the aging process including a set of evolutionary highly conserved basic biological mechanisms responsible for body maintenance and repairOne of the key mechanisms is inflammation a typical featureof the aging process is the development of a chronic lowgrade inflammatory status named �inflammaging� [8cid129] whichemerged as critical in the pathogenesis of major agerelatedchronic diseases such as atherosclerosis type  diabetes and neuro degeneration Inflammaging plays a pivotal role in themost important geriatric conditions such as sarc ia [9cid129cid129]osteoporosis [] frailty and disability thus contributing tomortality [] Interestingly a variety of tissues adipose tissue muscle ans brain liver systems immune systemand ecosystems gut microbiota of the body indicated as�subsystems� can contribute to the onset and progressionof such a systemic inflammatory state [] by increasing theproduction of several proinflammatory mediators or loweringthat of the antiinflammatory ones [8cid129]To differentiate the innocuous changes from those leadingto increased risk of disease disability or death biogerontologists tend to use a more precise term�senescence�when describing aging [] Senescence is thereforethe progressive deterioration of bodily functions over time andnormal human aging has been associated with a loss of complexity in a wide range of physiological processes and anatomic structures [] including blood pressure [] strideintervals [] respiratory cycles [] and vision [] amongothers such as postural dynamics [] ultimately leading todecreased fertility and increased risk or mortality []Systemic consequences of aging are widespread but theycan be clustered into four domains Fig � Changing in body composition�The balance between energy availability and energydemandSignaling networks that maintain homeostasis�� NeurodegenerationThese changes develop in parallel and affect each otherthrough many feedforward and feedback loopThe phenotype that results from the aging process is characterized by increased susceptibility to disease high risk ofmultiple coexisting diseases impaired response to stress theemergence of �geriatric syndromes� altered response to treatment high risk of disability and loss of personal autonomywith all its psychological and social consequences On theother hand all these factors influence aging itself in a dynamic and parallel way so that they can be considered as not onlya consequence of aging but also an integral part of the agingprocessTheories of AgingHuman aging is currently defined as a dynamic process involving the continual adaptation of the body to lifelong exposure tointernal and external damaging as conceptualized in the �remodelling theory of aging� [21cid129cid129] Theories of aging are generallyclassified as either program or damage theories Programmedaging theories suggest that there is a deliberate deterioration withage because a limited life span results in evolutionary benefits[] This plan could be a result of �aging genes� The firstdescribed mutation to yield a significant extension in the life spanof Caenorhabditis elegans was in the ageI gene which wasshown to result in a  increase in mean life span and a increase in maximum life span of this anism []Evolutionary biologists may argue that aging occurs due to theabsence of natural selection at the postreproductive stage of life[] Although such aging theories are subjectively appealing asthey convey a cure for aging the accumulation of damage is aspontaneous entropydriven process [] Among the damage 0cCurr Oncol Rep            Fig  Systemic consequences ofagingPage  of     theories a prevailing idea is that of oxidative damage Reactiveoxygen species ROS are generated during metabolism throughseveral interrelated reactions The supposition that aging may becaused by ROS has been further substantiated by studies involving transgenic animals for genes encoding antioxidants The lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster has been extended by overexpression of both superoxide dismutase SOD and catalase bothantioxidant enzymes [] Since mitochondria are the major producer of ROS in mammalian cells mitochondrial DNAmtDNA is therefore particularly susceptible to oxidative damage [] Mitochondrial maintenance is therefore essential topreserve cellular homeostasis and impaired mitochondrial maintenance has been described as a shared hallmark of numeroushuman pathologies and aging [] Mitochondrial DNA varieswith age and it is commonly considered that DNA hypomethylation is a typical aspect of the aging process [] ROS are activeintermediates of DNA methylation as well as histone modification These reactive oxygen species may play a role in epigeneticprocesses physiological phenotypic variations caused by external or environmental factors that switch genes onoff throughreactions of nucleophilic substitution at the DNA levelConsequently it has been suggested that better preservation ofDNA methylation levels slower cell metabolism and improvedcontrol in signal transmission through epigenetic mechanismscould be key processes involved in human longevity Oxidativedamage to proteins is irreversible and irreparable [] and mustbe degraded by the proteasome The proteasome is the mostimportant proteolytic machinery in eukaryotic cells largely responsible for the removal of oxidized proteins and the preventionof its aggregation [] However it has been shown that theactivity of proteasome is impaired during aging leading to theaccumulation of oxidizing proteins aggresome and lipofuscinsocalled the age pigment Similarly to oxidative damage nitrosamine damage�that caused by reactive nitrogen speciesRNS such as nitric oxide�has been suggested to also contribute to agerelated diseases namely hepatic steatosis and apoptosis [] as well as functional and structural changes in the cardiovascular system [ ] sleep homeostasis [] psychological disorders [] and dementia []Most supporters of the genomic instability theory of agingrefer to telomere shortening [] and mutation in DNA mitochondrial Telomeres are the repeated DNA sequences at theends of linear chromosomes which are unable to be fullyreplicated by DNA polymerasesMutations in mtDNA cause a wide range of human mitochondrial diseases and have been implicated in agerelateddiseases and agingBiomarker FeaturesFinding the biomarker of aging is one of the most importantgoals of medicine The National Institutes of HealthBiomarkers Definitions Working Group defined a biomarkeras �a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluatedas an indicator of normal biological processes pathogenicprocesses or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention� []The American Federation for Aging Research AFAR recommends the following criteria for biomarkers of aging [39cid129]It must predict a person�s physiological cognitive andphysical function in an agerelated way independentlyof chronological age 0c    Page  of Curr Oncol Rep            It must be testable and not harmful to test subjects forexample a blood test or an imaging

humanssince preliminary testing is always done in nonhumansubjectsFerrucci et al reviewed the biomarkers proposed as elements of a theory based on the balance between �resiliencemechanisms� and �accumulated damages� where biomarkersact in reducing resilience mechanisms or increasing damages[40cid129] Tables  and The pathways eligible to become biomarkers are thefollowingGenomic Instability Endogenous and exogenous agents continuously challenge the integrity of DNA when DNA repairmechanisms cannot manage the repeated damage the result isan accumulation of DNA somatic mutations This phenomenon causes dysregulation of gene expression and the production of altered proteins that lead to cellular damage Somaticmutation accumulation has been observed in skeletal musclecells neurons and lymphocytes B related to aging [�]nevertheless quantification of DNA repair capacity in humanshas yet to be finalized [�]Telomere Attrition Telomeres are the DNA sequences that areplaced at the

circulating cells however no techniqueshave been validated for evaluating aging because of the heterogeneity between different cells between individuals andhigh measurement errors that make these techniques not yetvalid in clinical practice [�]Epigenetic Alterations Epigenetics refers to those mechanismsexternal to DNA that modulate gene expression in cells theregulation of gene expression determines the phenotypic characteristics of the different cells and tissues The main mechanismsare DNA methylation histone modification and noncodingRNA While DNA methylation is easily measured in circulatingcells and seems to be correlated to aging [ ] measuringhistone modification or noncoding RNA is difficult and expensive Recent evidence correlates DNA methylation with agingand agerelated

be agood biomarker but to date there are no valid techniques forthis purposeMitochondrial Dysfunction The main role of mitochondria isto guarantee energy for the cell through the production ofATP They are also involved in signaling by the productionof ROS and in apoptosisprogrammed cell deathMitochondrial dysfunction is a good biomarker of aging andis associated with disability in older persons through the reduction of muscle strength [65cid129]Many techniques are measuring oxidative phosphorylationand ROS generation that have been associated with chronicdisease [ ] nevertheless the relation with aging is notcompletely validatedCellular Senescence Genomic instability telomere shorteningand other endogenous and exogenous mechanisms can inducethe cell to activate specific pathways that lead to apoptosis[] This process is called cellular senescence and is characterized by structural and functional changes in the cell []Senescent cells produce proinflammatory cytokines andchemokines growth factors and matrix proteases called �senescenceassociated secretory phenotype� SASP [ ]which may induce some agerelated diseases [�] Thedetection of SASP has been proposed as a biomarker of aging[]Deregulated NutrientSensing Genetic mutations in growthhormone and the insulinlike growth factor have been linkedto longevity [] Moreover dietary restriction showed to increase life span in primates [ ] For these reasons thispathway has been proposed as biomarkers of agingSteam Cell Exhaustion The decline in the regenerative potential is one of the elements at the base of aging [] Despitepharmacological interventions being explored to counteractthis phenomenon [] evidences are still poor 0c    Page  of Curr Oncol Rep            Altered Intercellular Communication With aging we also observe changes in intercellular communication as inflammatory reaction increases the other communication ways becomedysfunctional endocrine neuronal immune system []As we discussed earlier inflammation can be inappropriately increased in aging and this has been related to agerelated disease [ ]Indeed the pathways described as potential biomarkers ofaging are strongly related to inflammation for this reasonmeasuring circulating levels of cytokines is considered anew field of research [ 84cid129 ]Aging and Life ExpectancyAging and life expectancy are closely related In a broadsense determining an individual�s life expectancy is also away of schematizing his or her aging process Life expectancyis a statistical measure of the average time an anism isexpected to live based on the year of its birth LEB itscurrent age and demographic factors including gender []In the last decades life expectancy has increased in high income country the rise in human life expectancy has involveddeclines in intrinsic and extrinsic mortality processes associated respectively with senescence and environmental challenges []In association to this increased longevity there are diseasescalled agerelated that increase quadratically with age andcause a progressive loss of physical mental and cognitiveintegrities leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to morbidity mortality [] and disability in additionto increasing care needs and agerelated burden measuredthrough the sum of disabilityadjusted life years DALYs ofthese diseases among these adults Fig  Ninetytwo of the of the Global Burden of Disease causes were identified asagerelated diseases In particular cardiovascular diseaseneoplasm and chronic respiratory disorders are those withhigher agerelated disease burden []Determinants of Frailty Syndrome as AgingBiomarkerFrailty can be defined as a state of increased vulnerabilityto stressors or a loss of capacity to resolve homeostasisperturbation Frailty condition is closely related to aging[88cid129cid129] and the frailty indexes can consequently be considered biomarkers of aging themselves In frail individuals it is possible to find both changing in body composition and balance between energy availability and energydemand Moreover in the definition of frailty it is welldescribed how signaling networks maintain homeostasisand association with neurodegeneration These fouraspects all refer to the hallmarks of aging Frailty is associated with adverse clinical outcomes including falls institutionalization and death [88cid129cid129]Two principal models emerged in the last decades that areable to conceptualize and consequently measure frailty in everyday clinical practice and research the �frailty phenotype�model and the cumulative deficits modelThe frailty phenotype was first described by Fried and colleagues in  analyzing data from the CardiovascularHealth Study CHS involving  men and women aged years and older In this study it was investigated whichcharacteristics of the population were predictive of falls disability hospitalization and death Their operational definitionof frailty included a cluster of at least three of the followingvariables unintentional weight loss selfreported exhaustionlow energy expenditure slow gait speed and weak gripstrength This model does not take into consideration cognitive impairment as a cause of increased vulnerability as thiscould contribute to functional decline and adverse events inolder people [ ]The cumulative deficits model was developed byRockwood and colleagues as part of the prospectiveCanadian Study of Health and Aging CSHA involvinga cohort of  older adults [] The authors identified  parameters including diseases disabilities signssymptoms and laboratory values which were defined as�deficits� The sum of the deficits in a single individualallowed for the calculation of a frailty index ie thenumber of deficits divided by  Frailty in this modelis not considered as a cluster of symptoms but is conceptualized as a gradable syndrome with a higher number ofdeficits implying an increased vulnerability state The twomodels of frailty show significant overlap although theycapture slightly different sides of the same problem It isimportant to notice that physical frailty is frequently associated with multimorbidity [ 93cid129 ]It has been observed that the frailty phenotype construct is intrinsically related to mobility issues Indeedin older adults physical performance measures are a robust and consistent predictor for disability hospitalization institutionalization and death both in the researchand in the clinical setting Lower physical performance isfrequently associated with loss of skeletal muscle massand quality causing reduced strength and functional impairment [95cid129cid129] This process has been called sarc iaEven though sarc ia has been long associated withaging it has to be acknowledged that it can develop muchearlier in life [] Different definitions exist for this condition for the operational definition of sarc ia both inthe clinic and for research purposes that prioritize theassessment of muscle strength over muscle mass to identity sarc ic patients Strength is more closely related tosurvival and functional decline compared with muscle 0cCurr Oncol Rep

needs aging biomarkersIn  Robert J Havighurst said �In considering theneeds of older people it is well first to remember that olderpeople have the needs that are common to all people andsecond that they have special needs due to the fact that theyare old people� This sentence describes everything there is toknow about the need for the elderly and answers the questionbeforeIn every society and age there is what is meant by normality An elderly person in this scenario needs what is needed tomaintain this level of normalcy Activity of daily living andinstrumental activity of daily living ADL

total health care expenditures This  is represented by older people individuals with multiple chronic conditions many medications frequent hospitalizations and limitations on their ability to perform basic daily functions due tophysical mental or psychosocial challenge []Since the health care and social needs of older adults differfrom that of other adults it is necessary to identify the needs ofthe elderly to make proper plans that will promote their healthCurrently most of the conducted studies had mainly focused on the elderly physical health needs and had neglectedto take into account other needs such as social and health careneeds Furthermore in addition to quantitative studies discovering the older adults� �perceptions� of their own health needsis also necessaryConclusionThere is

fluctuations in blood glucose []DM presents an excellent model by which to demonstrate the reciprocaleffects of sleep disruption on the primary disease First sleep disturbances affectthe regulation of the neuroendocrine control of appetite Sleep deprivationpromotes overeating through hyperactivity of orexin system [] and activatesthe hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal system to increase cortisol

by overlapping comorbidities common to both OSA and CKD[] The cooccurrence of both CKD and OSA is associated with increasedcardiovascular events and allcause mortality [�] Usually OSA develops inpatients with CKD independent of underlying renal dysfunction but someevidence shows that CKD can cause or exacerbate OSA and central sleep apneaProposed mechanisms for this causal relationship

expression was mainly localized in the lamina propria In the same vein Vaarala et a0al reported TMPRSS2 expression in mouse salivary tissues []Cell Detection MethodsThe following methods have been used for detecting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cells of human and animal tissue RNAseq N   IHC N   RTPCR N   in a0situ hybridization ISH N   and WB N   Different detection approaches were used in  studies [ ] One study reported specific genetic analysis [] There were significant differences between studies regarding methods used While Ziegler et a0al and Sungnak et a0al detected ACE2 by RNAseq in goblet cells Lee et a0al did not find any immunohistochemical labeling [  ] However the results reported in sustentacular cells agree in the same direction whatever the technique used whether by RNAseq or by ISH and immunocytochemistry [�] The discrepancies are rather observed between studies having performed immunohistochemistry Indeed using two different antibodies Hikmet did not find ACE2 expression in nasopharynx epithelium whereas others demonstrated the staining of the apical surface of epithelia and ciliated epithelial cells [  ] Interestingly all the studies which carried out RNAseq found an expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 at the epithelial level which implies that the technique used could generate biases between the studies [ � �] 0cHead and Neck Pathology DiscussionThe presentation of COVID19 infection may be in several clinical forms ranging from anosmia in isolation to severe multiple an failure and death The mechanisms underlying the COVID19 polymorphism are still unknown To infect tissues SARSCoV2 needs to entry into the cells which is allowed through ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors [] The identification of virus receptor expression in the tissues makes particularly sense to better understand the clinical expression of the disease This systematic review sheds light on many pointsFirst ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors are expressed in epithelial and nonepithelial cells throughout the head and neck The head and neck expression may support the otolaryngological clinical picture of the disease which was recently found in European and North American COVID patients [   ] By entering the body via the epithelial cells of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa the SARSCoV2 virus leads to an inflammatory reaction and the development of otolaryngological symptoms Nasal entrance of the virus through high ACE2 expression was supported in the study of Wu et a0al who found a higher virus concentration in nasal swabs compared with throat swabs []The olfactory cleft is a nasal region that has drawn the attention of many researchers over the past few weeks Indeed recent data supported that more than  of COVID19 patients developed subjective olfactory dysfunction especially when patients suffered from mildtomoderate forms of the disease [   ] Because ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in the nasal mucosa of the olfactory cleft entrance into the olfactory bulb seems plausible Once in the bulb according to some human studies [ ] the virus could infect cells that express ACE2 or TMPRSS2 namely glial and neuronal stem cells Fig a0Integrating the molecular clinical and radiological characteristics of SARSCOV2 olfactory loss may shed light about its pathophysiological process Taking into account that the loss is often temporary SARSCOV2 may primarily infect the sustentacular cells supporting the olfactory sensory neurons This infection may cause rapid disruption of the olfactory epithelium structure and function with a possible inflammatory response inducing sudden onset smell loss This inflammation is observed in a minority of patient with congested olfactory cleft who underwent CT scan [   �]ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are also found in horizontal basal olfactory stem cells located in the basal layer They are less exposed to the external environment thus less likely to be infected in first line the loss would have been more Fig    Epithelium of Olfactory Cleft The figure summarizes the olfactory cleft epithelium 0c Head and Neck Pathologyprogressive However once infected they might slow down recovery time because horizontal basal cells give rise to many cell type in the olfactory epithelium They may also contribute to virus spread to the olfactory bulb vascular pericytes Magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies of the olfactory bulb [ ] in which ACE2 are only expressed in vascular pericytes but not in neurons may show inflammatory signs suggesting that the infection process can extend more centrally and promote inflammatory response [] Inflammatory causes are often quickly reversible for example after a oneweek trial of high dose of corticosteroids or simply days after the resolution of the viral infection suggesting that the olfactory neurons and bulbs are still somewhat intact This seems to be the case for a majority of patients In contrast with more sustained destruction of neuronal olfactory structures the recovery time is much longer and may take � a0years given the slow neuroregeneration process [ ]In this systematic review we found that three studies reported high ACE2 expression in major or minor salivary gland human tissues [  ] These data corroborate the literature findings that reported a salivary pattern of SARSCoV2 and related parotitis [ ] Moreover the virus spread into the salivary gland tissues allows us a better understanding the mechanisms underlying salivary transmission Interestingly in  Liu et a0al observed that monkeys infected by SARSCoV had a salivary viral spread which was associated with a salivary virion excretion [] These data support the need to conduct future studies investigating the presence of SARSCoV2 in the saliva of infected human and to corroborate the saliva findings with the ACE2 salivary gland expressionThe head and neck expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and the related otolaryngological symptom pattern seems obvious but could vary across individuals and populations In support of this Lee et a0al observed that ACE2 expression is influenced by patient demographics clinical characteristics comorbidities and medication [] As reported in the genetic analysis of Cao et a0al there would be different susceptibilities or responses to SARSCoV2 in different populations [] The polymorphism of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression could explain the clinical differences between individuals Indeed many physicians reported in clinical and epidemiological studies different clinical presentation of the disease [ ] which could be associated with virus mutations [  ] The virus mutations and the related impact on receptor binding and infectivity is another point that has to be considered in future studies Otherwise according to the Bgee database https bgee expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 evaluated in murine models may increase with age These findings have to be confirmed in humans but could explain more severe clinical pictures in the elderlyThe present study has several limitations First the heterogeneity between studies about the detection method may lead to detection bias as some approaches are more sensitive than others Some studies interrogate gene expression at mRNA level and others at protein levels both types of analysis having their advantages and limitations Compared to transcriptomic analyzes immunohistochemistry brings additional important spatial information in tissue samples but recently Sorokin et a0al demonstrated high and statistically significant correlations between the RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical measurements [] Interestingly they highlighted the complementarity of both techniques for measuring cancer biomarkers in FFPE samples However differences observed across IHC studies suggest the involvement of many parameters The antibody specificity is a big challenge to ensure reproducibility of antibodybased studies and given the high homology between ACE1 and ACE2 cautions must be taken regarding antibody selection Besides a report from the International Working Group for Antibody Validation IWGAV proposed five scientific approaches to validate antibody specificity [] then such strategies must be considered in future investigations to confirm the published observations In addition it seems essential to enlarge and diversify patient cohorts and to combine transcriptomic and proteomic strategies as well as colocalize different markers of SARSCoV2 such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to provide an accurate representation of ACE2 expression through all head and neck areas of the whole populationSecond the majority of studies that were conducted during the SARSCoV2 pandemic did not consider many demographic and clinical factors such as the age of patients from who the tissues were extracted or the use of ACE inhibitor medications among others Third some otolaryngological regions remain uninvestigated such as the vocal folds The investigation of these remaining regions may shed further light on some recently reported unusual clinical phenomena such as severe dysphonia []ConclusionACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both expressed in head and neck tissues which may explain the otolaryngological clinical pattern of the disease and the entry of SARSCoV2 into the host anism Future studies considering demographical and clinical characteristics of patients from who the tissues are extracted are needed to better understand the cell entry mechanisms of SARSCoV2Author contributions  JR TR SS JM design acquisition of data data analysis  interpretation

in line with the phenotypic changesobserved in the cartilage of KBD patients64 However itshould be noted that growth retardation caused by selenium deﬁciency may also be associated with the

indicate that there are no differences inselenium levels between OA and normal tissues Theselenium concentrations in synovial ﬂuid and plasma of OA patients were not significantly different from thoseof  healthy controls106 Similarly no significant difference in selenium concentration was noted between sixdogs with posttraumatic OA and six control dogs107Second the beneﬁcial effect of selenium supplementationin alleviating OA symptoms has been debated The resultsfrom a controlled doubleblind trial of  patientsOfﬁcial journal of the Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular

Suchsurveillance tasks require many epidemiological and statistical methods with geospatial features in investigatingepidemics preferably from localized areas The reason forpreferring the local areas

CNVR per goat breed was    CNVR50 breeds which is much smaller than the number we found here  CNVR We attribute this difference to the fact that the previous study included multiple caprine breeds that were represented by small to moderate numbers of individuals Given the low frequencies of CNV in our study the average frequency of CNV is  such a design would probably underestimate the levels of the diversity of CNV at the within�breed level We also observed that functions related with sensory perception metabolism and embryo development are overrepresented in the set of genes that overlapped with CNV and that these loci often belong to large multigene families with tens hundreds or thousands of paralogous members a feature that could favor the occurrence of duplications or

detect structural variations  in  cattle  have  revealed  that  CNV  regions CNVR are often enriched in genes that are involved in immunity [�] metabolism [ ] embryo development [ ] and sensory perception [ ] There is evidence that the  dNdS ratios of genes that map to taurine CNV are generally higher than those of genes that do not overlap with CNV which indicates that CNV genes probably evolve under reduced selective constraint [] The analysis of gene networks has also shown that genes that  colocalize  with  duplications  tend  to  have  fewer interactions with other genes than loci that do not overlap  with  CNV  reinforcing  the  idea  that  genes  mapping to duplicated regions have fewer essential housekeeping functions  than  nonCNV  genes  and  also  have  reduced pleiotropy []Although structural chromosomal variations can have strong  effects  on  gene  expression  and  phenotypic  variability  technical  limitations  and  the  moderate  quality of genome assemblies have hampered CNV mapping in livestock  []  Until  recently  this  has  been  particularly true for goats In  Fontanesi et a0al [] published the first  caprine  CNV  map  by  identifying  with  the  Bovine a0k aCGH array  CNVR including  and  copy loss and gain variants respectively Later on resequencing  the  genome  of  individuals  from  several  caprine breeds  made  it  possible  to  identify  CNV  that  overlap with  pigmentation genes and to detect an association between increased ASIP copy number and light pigmentation  []  The  first  worldwide  survey  of  copy  number  variation  in  goats  was  performed  within  the  Goat ADAPTmap Project httpwwwgoata daptm ap and involved the genomewide genotyping of  goats from  breeds [] This study resulted in the identification of  CNVR among which several overlapped with genes that  are  functionally  related  with  local  adaptation  such as coat color muscle development metabolic processes and embryonic development [] Moreover the patterns of the diversity of CNV differed according to geographic origin  which  indicates  that  they  have  been  influenced by population history [] In another study on  individuals from  East African goat breeds Nandolo et a0al [] detected  CNVR More recently Henkel et a0al [] demonstrated the existence of complex patterns of structural variation in the regions containing the caprine ASIP and KIT genes with potential causal effects on pigmentation In spite of these efforts the description of structural chromosomal  variation  in  goats  is  still  lagging  behind that of other domestic species Most of the CNV surveys in goats have analyzed large populations that represent a mixture of different breeds each with a limited number of individuals [ ] thus making it difficult to assess the magnitude of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level Our goal was to fill this gap by analyzing a population of  individuals from a single Spanish breed MurcianoGranadina  and  to  investigate  the  functional  roles  of genes that map to CNVR and compare these results with data obtained in composite goat populationsMethodsGenomic DNA extraction and a0high�throughput genotypingBlood  samples

analysis 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of DiscussionIn this work our aim was to characterize copy number variation  in  MurcianoGranadina  goats  a  native  Spanish breed used for milk production By genotyping  MurcianoGranadina  goats  with  a  SNP  array  we  were able  to  identify    CNVR  covering    of  the  goat genome  whereas  Liu  et a0 al  []  identified  CNVR  that covered   of the goat genome The latter higher percentage reported by Liu et a0al [] can be explained by the fact that they analyzed  breeds with different geographical  origins  ie  a  composite  population  that  is probably much more diverse than that used in our work Besides  the  pipeline  that  we  used  to  identify  CNVR is more stringent than that employed by Liu et a0al [] removing CNVR that were not consistently detected by PennCNV and QuantiSNP In the literature estimates of  to  for CNVR coverage in the human genome are reported [] Our results and those obtained by Liu et a0al [] are consistent with these valuesIndeed  when  Liu  et a0 al  []  calculated  the  CNVR length  for  each  breed  normalized  by  the  goat  genome size their results agreed well with our estimate of  For  instance  this  parameter  reached  values  of   in  goats  from  Southeastern  Africa  and    in  goats from  Northwestern  Africa  and  Eastern  Mediterranean whereas it was lowest  for individuals from West Asia  []  The  number  of  CNV  detected  at  the  withinbreed  level  by  Liu  et a0 al  []  was  on  average    CNV per breed and ranged from  to  whereas the average number of CNVR was only   per breed [] Since the number of detected CNVR is proportional to population size for most of the breeds investigated in [] the level of withinbreed CNV variation is probably underestimated In summary one important conclusion from our study is that the magnitude of CNV diversity at the withinbreed  level  is  likely  to  be  much  larger  than  that previously  reported  in  studies  that  analyzed  multiple populations  each  represented  by  a  small  or  moderate number of individualsMost of the CNVR that we report here ranged in size from  to a0kb with a mean size of a0kb Similarly the average CNVR size reported by Liu et a0al [] was a0kb Both estimates are quite large and reflect that mediumdensity SNP arrays are not well suited to detect small CNVR in spite of their high abundance In cattle the  average  sizes  of  CNVR  detected  with  the  Illumina BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip a0K SNPs [] Illumina wholegenome sequencing and PacBio sequencing []  were      and  a0 kb  respectively  Another consistent feature of CNVR is that in general their frequencies are low or very low In our study approximately   of  the  CNVR  had  frequencies  lower  than    and the average frequency was  Liu et a0al [] reported lower  CNVR  frequencies  ranging  from    Alpine and  Northern  European  goats  to    Northwestern African goats This decreased average CNVR frequency is  not  very  significant  and  probably  reflects  differences in  sampling  size  and  the  use  of  composite  populations with  multiple  breeds  each  one  with  its  specific  CNVR frequenciesThe CNVR detected in our study covered  proteincoding  genes  Pathway  analyses  reflected  a  substantial enrichment  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  olfactory  perception  which  is  consistent  with  previous  reports  in cattle [ ] In this regard there is an important difference between our results and those by Liu et a0al [] Whereas in the study of Liu et a0al [] the term �sensory perception� was underrepresented among the CNV genes fold enrichment   in our work the terms �olfactory transduction�  fold  enrichment    and  �Gprotein coupled  purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity�  fold enrichment    were  overrepresented  and  many CNV  genes  were  olfactory  receptors  The  two  terms mentioned  before  are  closely  related  because  a  broad array of purinergic receptors are differentially expressed in  the  olfactory  receptor  neurons  that  modulate  odor responsiveness  []  Moreover  purinergic  nucleotides are  important  neuromodulators  of  peripheral  auditory and visual sensory systems [] In cattle Keel et a0al [] reported that �sensory perception of smell� and �Gprotein  coupled  receptor  signaling  pathway�  were  significantly overrepresented in the proteincoding genes that overlapped  with  CNVR  Similarly  Upadhyay  et a0 al  [] showed that �sensory perceptions of smell� and �chemical  stimuli�  are  enriched  in  their  set  of  CNV  genes  A potential  explanation  for  the  underrepresentation  of the �sensory perception� functional category among the genes overlapping CNV reported by Liu et a0al [] could be that in goats these genes are not well annotated yet so the majority of them are identified with a LOC prefix and a number and as a consequence of this they are not  correctly  detected  by  PANTHER  []  thus  biasing the  results  obtained  in  the  gene  ontology  enrichment analysisLoci  belonging  to  large  multigene  families  might  be more  prone  to  colocalize  with  CNV  because  paralogous  genes  can  act  as  templates  in  nonallelic  homologous  recombination  events  which  promote  increases or  reductions  in  copy  number  []  It  should  be  noted that olfactory receptor genes constitute the largest gene superfamily  and  in  humans  more  than    genes  and pseudogenes  have  been  identified  []  In  cattle   olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes are distributed in    clusters  across    bovine  chromosomes  []  and similar numbers have been reported for pigs [] Moreover  purifying  selection  against  CNV  is  probably  less  0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol             Page  of intense in regions that contain olfactoryreceptor genes than in genomic regions that contain genes with essential functions [] Interestingly copy number changes in the olfactory receptor genes of wild and domestic mammals might have consequences on food foraging as well as on mate and predator recognition [ ]In the set of genes that colocalize with CNVR we also detected  an  enrichment  of  loci  related  with  the  multigene  family  of  ATP  binding  cassette  ABC  transporters  a  result  that  agrees  well  with  previous  findings  in humans  [�]  and  cattle  [  ]  In  mammals  ABC transporters fulfill the mission of carrying a broad array of endogenous substrates such as amino acids peptides sugars anions and hydrophobic compounds and metabolites  across  lipid  membranes  At  least    ABC  genes that belong to eight subfamilies have been identified in the human genome [] Copy number variation in the human ABCC4 and ABCC6 genes is associated with susceptibility  to  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  [] and to the rare autosomal recessive disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum [] respectively Moreover largescale deletions of the human ABCA1 gene are a causative factor  for  hypoalphalipoproteinemia  []  a  disease  that  is characterized by the complete absence of the apolipoprotein AI and extremely low levels of plasma highdensity lipoprotein  HDL  cholesterol  We  also  found  a  highly significant enrichment of pathways related with embryo development  anteriorposterior  pattern  specification embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis as previously reported [] These pathways are featured by genes that belong to the Hox multigene family of transcription factors possibly reflecting the genomic instability of certain homeobox gene clusters as evidenced by the existence of many syntenyparalogy breakpoints and assembly gaps as outlined in comparative studies []Although  not  significant  after  correction  for  multiple testing  we  detected  an  enrichment  of  pathways  with metabolic  significance  such  as  prolactin  and  insulin signaling which could have an impact on milk production  and  growth  [�]  Interestingly  the  comparison of our work with that of Liu et a0al [] revealed  proteincoding genes that colocalize with the set of shared CNVR One of the most relevant shared genes encodes ASIP a protein that increases the ratio of pheomelanin to  eumelanin  by  binding  to  the  melanocortin    receptor  and  delivering  an  antagonist  signal  that  blocks  the downstream expression of eumelanogenic enzymes [] Mutations in the ASIP gene play critical roles in animal pigmentation [] For instance the causal factor of the white color typical of many sheep breeds is the ubiquitous expression of a duplicated copy of the ASIP coding sequence  which  is  regulated  by  a  duplicated  promoter corresponding  to  the  itchy  E3  ubiquitin  protein  ligase gene  [  ]  Although  some  studies  proposed  that  the ASIP CNV might be associated with different pigmentation patterns in goats [  ] no functional assay has verified an association of ASIP copy number with ASIP mRNA  levels  Another  interesting  shared  copy  number variable gene is ADAMTS20 which was also identified in two previous CNV surveys [ ] This gene encodes a metalloproteinase with an important role in melanoblast survival by mediating Kit signaling [] and in palatogenesis [] Bertolini et a0al [] performed a selection scan in white vs colored black and red goats and detected a selective sweep in the ADAMTS20 gene In the light of these  results  the  potential  involvement  of  a  structural variation  in  ADAMTS20  in  goat  pigmentation  should be explored further Moreover it is worthwhile to mention that several CNVR genes have functions related with production  and  reproduction  traits  For  instance  the NCKAP5 gene which colocalizes with CNVR_160_chr2 frequency   is associated with milk fat percentage in  cattle  []  Taking  the  above  evidence  into  account the implication of structural chromosomal variations in the  genetic  determinism  of  traits  of  economic  interest with a complex inheritance deserves further exploration by designing tools that allow inferring CNVR genotypes with high confidenceConclusionsWith  the  PennCNV  and  QuantiSNP  software  we detected    CNVR  in  the  genome  of  the  MurcianoGranadina  breed  In  a a0 previous  study  []  that  used  a less  stringent  pipeline  only  PennCNV  was  used  and included  multiple  populations  with  small  to  moderate  sample  sizes  the  average  number  of  CNVR  events per breed was   One conclusion of our study is that CNV surveys which are based on a broad array of breeds represented  by  only  a  few  individuals  underestimate the true levels of the CNV diversity at the withinbreed level The main reason for this outcome is that since the majority of CNV have very low frequencies they cannot be detected efficiently when sample size is small and in consequence  much  of  the  existing  variation  is  missed We have also found that genes that overlap with CNV are functionally related with olfactory transduction embryo development  ABC  transporters  and  Gprotein  coupled purinergic  nucleotide  receptor  activity  Most  of  these genes  belong  to  large  multigene  families  encompassing tens  hundreds  or  thousands  of  paralogous  genes  that could act as substrates in nonallelic homologous recombination  events  which  is  one  of  the  main  mechanisms generating  duplications  and  deletions  in  humans  and other  species  Finally  we  detected  CNV  that  colocalize with the ASIP and ADAMTS20 pigmentation genes 0cGuan a0et a0al Genet Sel Evol

Type  DM T2DM [] The risk of developing T2DM is strongly associated withmany predispositions behavioral and environmental risk factors and also genetic factors [�] Besides the genetic factors strong evidence indicates that factors such asobesity and physical inactivity are the main nongenetic determinants of the disease [] T2DM can range from predominant insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to dominant defective secretion with insulin resistance [] It is often related tometabolic syndrome problems Individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance arehighrisk subjects of type

are susceptible to many forms of complications leadingto morbidity and mortality in these patients Many studies emphasize the genetic factors in the pathogenesis of T2DM [  ] Long noncoding RNAs long

class of regulatory lncRNAs with transcriptlengths   nucleotides which have a positive role in the development and growth ofseveral various diseases including T2DM supporting the hypothesis that

thevarious data mining techniques For the implementation of the algorithms we usedANACONDA3�  bit a free and  source platform distribution of pythonprogramming language with a vast number of modules packages and rich libraries thatprovide various methods for classification problems For obtaining the best amount ofperformance in the models 10fold crossvalidation performed on the dataset In dealing with the small data sets crossvalidation is a prominent strategy for estimating theperformance CrossValidation is a performance evaluation technique commonly usedin practice Here the data set is repeatedly partitioned into two nonoverlapping partsa training set and a holdout set For each partitioning the holdout set is used fortesting while the remainder is used for training The two most popular variants aretenfold crossvalidation 10fold CV where the data is split into ten mutually disjointfolds []Since our samples were more than  and to be sure that each fold contains thesame proportion of healthy and diabetic individuals we used the stratified 10foldcrossvalidation approach [] Therefore the results are reliable and more credibleWe applied four popular data mining approaches on the lncRNA variables regression knearest neighbors SVM and neural network classification algorithmsKNN algorithmThe knearest neighbor�s algorithm kNN is an algorithm for classifying variables regarding the closest training data in the feature space KNN uses an instancebasedlearning method which is one of the simplest algorithms among data mining techniques This method considers the nearest neighbors to each object and decides todedicate the object to classes [ ]SVM algorithmSupport Vector Machine SVM is a supervised algorithm which divides the featurespace called hyperplanes considering the target classes SVM computes classification bymaximizing the margin of the hyperplane that intercepts classes This algorithm plots amultidimensional hyperplane that divides classes and increases the margin betweenclasses to enhance the accuracy of classification We used different kernel functionsembedded in the SVM class of SVC library in python framework as a quadratic polynomial radial basis etc to classify the instance and to detect the best accuracy amongthem [�]Artificial neural networkArtificial Neural Network is a data processing algorithm that simulates the biologicalneural network in its computations A common problem in using ANN is that they actfundamentally as a black box and the parameters are set by the model so we cannotdemonstrate them [] we can just apply the model in our problems and obtain thehigh performance We used Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN Thestructure of a multilayer perceptron neural network has been demonstrated in

Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks MLPNN was performed The structure of MLPNN is as shown in Fig  It makes a map of input dataonto a set of suitable output dataThe RBF networks are another type of neural network In MLP each neuron considers the weighted sum of its input values in which each input value is multiplied by acoefficient and the results are the sum of values RBF is a more intuitive approach toMLP An RBFN classifies the inputs by calculating the input�s similarity to examplesfrom the training set Each RBFN neuron stores one of the examples from the trainingset as a �prototype� for classification of new input in each neuron the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype is calculated The input is dedicated to aclass when it has more similar to that class than the other classesLogistic regressionLogistic regression is a common approach for predictive modeling practices The functionpX provides probability output between  and  for all values of X where X1�Xp are

variablesand we replaced them with zero Table lncRNA extraction and selectionIncreasing evidence has suggested several lncRNAs are implicated in T2DM pathogenesis Recently human βcell transcriptome analysis showed lncRNAs dynamic regulation and abnormal expression of lncRNAs in T2DM [] However the extent oflncRNA deregulation in T2DM has yet to be determined To date more than100 susceptibility

 to have the best performance and the lowest standard deviation in theaccuracy of the folds In addition in choosing the parameters of the artificial neuralnetwork the number of hidden layer neurons

and combiningthem to get the best detection power of T2DM and performing four outstanding datamining algorithms and comparing their performances As the limitations of this studywe should account for the limited number of samples which is due to the high costs ofmeasuring the Long noncoding RNAs No doubt the higher number of samples wouldlead to higher performance and more reliable resultsConclusionIn this paper the performance of conventional data mining classification techniqueshas been calculated and compared for a dataset of patients referred for the screeningof type

T2DMThe classification techniques compared were support vector machine artificial neuralnetwork decision tree nearest neighbors and logistic regression In data mining it isnot possible to say one classification technique will always work best and it often depends on the number of samples their distribution and the choosing of the right algorithm In this research work SVM and Logistic Regression had the best Area UnderCurve among methods of classification with the mean AUC of  KNN and ANNalso had the high mean AUC and small standard deviations of AUC scores among theapproaches KNN

cancer CRC is one of the leading cause ofdeath worldwide More than  million patients are diagnosed with CRC every year [�] What�s more this lifethreaten disease kills nearly  million people annually []In north America and Europe the morbidity and mortalityremain at high level [] despite developments of cancerscreening and endoscopy [ ] In China CRC becomesthe 5th most diagnosed cancer and 5th most deadly cancer[�] Nearly  million new cases are diagnosed andabout  million people die from the disease every year []Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy is firstline treatment for CRC patients [ ] Capecitabine a carbamatederivative of fluoropyrimidine is the backbone of CRCchemotherapy [ ] Asthe oral prodrug of fluorouracil 5FU it is widely used for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy due to its long stable durationlower toxicity and convenient dosing compared to infusional 5FU [ ] However this chemotherapeutic drughas only modest efficacy the response rates of 5FU foradvanced CRC is only  for single treatment and for combined chemotherapy [ ] The chemoresistance is recognized as a principal obstacle for cancer therapy [�] leading to tumor recurrence or metastasisespecially liver and lung metastasis and cause over  ofCRC mortality [] Intense researches on the mechanisms underlying the resistance revealed that changes oftumor cells themselves cause resistance although thesefindings are mainly restricted to tumor specimen examinewhich is not that suitable for posttreatment surveillanceWhat�s more CT computed tomography scan and colonoscopy are insensitive to micro metastasis despite theirgoodrecurrenceCapecitabineresistant patients could only be diagnosedwith cancer recurrence by CT scan or colonoscopy about� years after capecitabine therapy [] when tumorsare big enough to be discovered Thus good prognosticmarkers are indispensable for predicting capecitabineresistance in the early stage after capecitabine therapydetection ofaccuracytheforCancer cells and their microenvironment could interactwith each other Immune cells could dynamically reflectcancer status and display multifaceted functions in cancerdevelopment [�] Myeloid cells including monocytesmacrophages granulocytes neutrophils eosinophils basophils and mast cells play critical roles in cancer progression [�] Myeloidderived suppressor cells MDSCs aheterogeneous population of myeloid cells remain at different stages of differentiation are immature counterparts ofmyeloid cells in cancer MDSCs acquire immunosuppressive features and mainly inhibit lymphocytes including Tcells and NK cells [�] Recent studies report that chemotherapeutic agents like 5FU could interact with myeloid cells and influence antitumor efficacy [�]Vincent J  reported that 5FU selectively inducedMDSC apoptotic cell death and increase IFN� productionby tumorspecific CD8T cells [] Other researchersshowed that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and increased amount of HSP70 exosomes on MDSC by 5FUlead to MDSC activation [ ] Yuan Y  found thattumorassociated macrophages secret IL6 to induce 5FUchemoresistance []ImportantlyIn this study we discovered that the expression ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells was dramatically decreased in capecitabineresistant CRC patients after capecitabine adjuvanttherapy The expression level ofCD16 was closely related to poor prognosis after capecitabine therapythe downregulation ofCD16 on CD11bmyeloid cells appeared as early as month after capecitabine therapy in patients who werediagnosed with capecitabineresistance by CT scansabout � years after the treatment The cutoff value ofCD16 expression  would be helpful for the prediction of capecitabine chemoresistance Further analysisdemonstrated that these CD11bCD16low��myeloid cellswere mainly immature

downregulated in capecitabineresistant patients and lower expression level of CD16 on neutrophils in peripheralblood was correlated with poor prognosis in CRC patients with capecitabine adjuvant therapy Importantlydownregulation of CD16 was observed as early as month after capecitabine treatment which was moresensitive than CT scan indicating its great value in clinical application We determined the cutoff value ofCD16 expression  on neutrophils for the prediction of capecitabine chemoresistance which would behelpful for clinical application and further researchesAnalyzationincapecitabineresistant patients revealed their immaturestatus and the expression of CD16 on neutrophils waspositively correlated with frequencies of antitumor immune cell

more some clinicaltrial also suggested that combining CEA and CT got no advantagecompared with single examine [] In this study ourresults showed that CD16 expression could serve as agood prognostic

treatment Fig  Previous studieshave demonstrated that  CRC patients had primary resistance to 5FU single treatment[ ]thus the marker is essential for the drugselection inthese patients Second this marker is quite accuratefor predicting capecitabineresistance after the therapy In our study we collected totally  CRC patients with capecitabinetheexpression level of CD16 on neutrophils Among

healthCapecitabine the oral form of 5FU which is widelyused in CRC therapy has only modest efficacy due tothe chemoresistance Great efforts have been taken tofind out the mechanism Previous studies mainly concentrated on tumor cells themselves such as expressionof specific genes or generation of particular tumor cells[ ] In this research we worked on the correlationbetween changes on immune system and capecitabinechemoresistance and illustrated the conversion fromneutrophilsto immunosuppressive PMNMDSClikeneutrophils in these capecitabine insensitive patients byRNA sequencing and flow cytometry Our conclusioncould also be supported by other studies that 5FUcould promote MDSC protumor function The study byBruchard M  found that 5FU could activate NLRP3inflammasome in MDSC and promote tumor growth[] Gobbo J  also discovered that 5FU facilitatedproduction of tumorderived HSP70 exosomes whichfavored MDSC activation [] Thus prevention ofMDSC function after capecitabine or 5FU therapyholds great promise for improving drug efficacyreceptorResearchers have revealed that CD16myeloid cellswere tightly related to CRC development[ ]Giulio S  found that CD16myeloid cell infiltration in CRC tumor tissue represented favorable prognosis [] and by using in vitro studies these studiesalso demonstrated that colon cancer infiltrate neutrophils enhance the responsiveness of CD8 T cells byTcelltriggering [] Our work differedfrom theirs in some ways Firstly our study focusedon CRC patients who received capecitabine adjuvanttreatment after surgery while Giulio Spagnoli groupfocused on all CRC patients and some healthy donorsSecondly biopsies from different positions were analyzed Peripheral blood was used in our study whileGiulio Spagnoli group mainly focused on tumor biopsies Exceptthese differences some of our resultswere also consistent with studies from Giulio Spagnoligroup Firstly both our data and Giulio Spagnoligroup�s data found that phenotype of peripheral bloodCD11bCD16myeloid cells had no difference betweenhealthy donors and CRC patients without capecitabinetherapy Fig S1F and G Secondly our work indicated that CD16 highpositive expression after capecitabine therapy predicted sensitivity to the therapyand good prognosis These results were consistentwith the work from Giulio Spagnoli groupthatCD16myeloid cells related to good prognosis of CRCpatientsMDSCs are a heterogeneous population of myeloidcells stay at different stages of differentiation PMNMDSCs are a great part of MDSCs that could be considered as counterparts of immature granulocytes chieflyimmature neutrophils []In this study we founddownregulation of CD16 expression on myeloid cells incapecitabineinsensitive CRC patients after capecitabinetreatment These CD16low��myeloid cells after the therapy were mainly immature neutrophils CD16 is a lowaffinity Fc� receptor which could activate antibodydependent process like phagocytosis in neutrophils andother phagocytes [] It is expressed on neutrophilsduring the maturation Researchers also revealed thatCD16 is typically associated with PMN activation andphagocytosis and its expression will change in differentmaturation status [ ] MDSCs could exert protumor roles mainly through inhibition of effective Tcells and NK cells [ ] Our study demonstrated thatlow expression of CD16 on neutrophils after the therapywas related to decreased frequencies of antitumor immune cells like CD8T cells and NK cells suggestingthatthey may have immunosuppressive activity asMDSCs The mechanism underlying the changes induced by capecitabine would be investigated further andit could be a good target to compete against capecitabinechemoresistanceConclusionsIn conclusion CD16 seems to be a promising target

[]According to the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology[] systemic opioids given to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery with general anesthesia activate opioidreceptors and stimulate various ans This often results in nausea and vomiting pruritus urinary retentionexcessive sedation and respiratory inhibition Thusinprinciple systemic opioids are not used for postoperativepain relief after day surgery The analgesic and adversereactions of mixed agonistantagonist opioids such asnalbuphine and dezocine also exhibit a ceiling effectImplementation of multimodal analgesia using NSAIDscan significantly reduce the dose of opioid and adversereactions and can be used postoperatively to managemoderate pain after ambulatory surgeryNalbuphine a mixed agonistantagonist opioid is associated with milder μ receptorrelated side effects Itsplasma halflife is  h and in clinical studies the durationof analgesic activity ranges from  to  h [] In ourstudy the VAS at rest of group E was less than  pointsand the difference was statistically significant comparedwith the VAS at rest before administration This indicates that nalbuphine could effectively relieve pain afterambulatory surgery Similar results were also observedin animal studies that showed amelioration of somaticand visceral pain in mice after treatment with nalbuphine []In the present study the VAS at rest at timepoints T1to T4 of the nalbuphine group group E did not differfrom that of the control At T5 the VAS at rest of thenalbuphine group was significantly lower than that ofthe tramadol group This indicates that the duration ofnalbuphine for pain relief after ambulatory surgery waslonger than that of tramadol There were  cases of adverse reactions in the nalbuphine group which wasnot significantly different from the  cases  in thetramadol groupThe incidence of adverse reactions associated with nalbuphine is relatively low compared with other opioidmedications A metaanalysis of randomized controlledtrials by Zeng  [] showed that nalbuphine hassimilar analgesic effects compared to morphine and abetter drug safety profile with a low incidence of postoperative pruritusrespiratory inhibition nausea andvomiting In addition studies have reported that antagonism of the μ receptor by nalbuphine could reduce theadverse reactions of other opioids as seen in the combination of morphine and nalbuphine in patientcontrolled analgesia or patientcontrolled epidural analgesia [ ] and the rate of adverse effects such asurinary retention related to morphine pruritus and nausea was significantly less Nalbuphine with sufentanilused in patientcontrolled analgesia could reduce the 0cGuan  BMC Anesthesiology            Page  of incidence of opioidrelated nausea and vomiting and improved patients� satisfaction with analgesia [ ]In the present study the difference in respiratoryrates before and after administration in both the nalbuphine and tramadol groups was not statistically significant and no respiratory depression was observedMany studies have reported that respiratory depression caused by nalbuphine is small and has a ceilingeffect [ ] In one study a neonate was wronglyadministered a tenfold higher dose than required ofnalbuphine and it resulted in only prolonged sedationwith no respiratory failure []studyIn the presentStudies have shown that preanesthetic injections ofnalbuphine could reduce stress responses and fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate during intubation [ ]the bloodpressures and heart rates of both groups after administration were significantly lower than at T1 althoughstill within normal ranges The blood pressure at T0Inception of the study was compared to the bloodpressure after surgery T1T5 the blood pressure atT1 was significantly higher than at T0 However atthe later timepoints T2 to T5 there were no statistical differences in the blood pressures compared toT0 The decrease in blood pressure after administration T2T5 may have been due to the alleviation ofpain If sothen the lowered blood pressure couldalso indicate the analgesic efficacy of nalbuphineThere are several limitations in this study First a limited number of parameters VAS score adverse eventsand change of vital signs were observed within the halflife of the medication Secondly the VAS scores were recorded at rest and not during movement Finally due toethical issues a placebo control group was not possibleTherefore we were not able to assess the effectiveness ofnalbuphine or tramadol at  and  h after administration Fortunately none of the patients dropped out during the  or  h after administration of medication forpain However the present results warrant further experiments to determine comprehensively the effectiveness and safety of nalbuphine for the treatment of painafter ambulatory surgeryConclusionThis study indicates that nalbuphine at a recommendeddose of  mgkg is safe and effective for pain management after ambulatory

SIBO can be an overlookedcause of poor wound healing during the treatment ofpressure soresSIBO was first reported by Vantrappen  as an increased concentration of 14CO2 in a bile acid breath testfor patients with an absent interdigestive motor complex[] Today consensus diagnostic criteria for SIBO arethe presence of more than  �  CFUmL of bacteriaor any amount of E coli in the proximal small bowelcontent [] Relatively little is known about commensalsinhabiting the small intestine mainly due to the limitedaccessibility of this environment for microbiological analysis [] In the healthy state the numbers of intestinalbacteria range from  to  CFUmL and mainly include gramnegative and grampositive aerobes such asStreptococcus Lactobacillus and Bacteroidesspecies[] Regarding the amount of bacteria in proximal jejunal aspiration Khoshini  report that normal subexceed  �  CFUmL and thereforejectsproposed more than  �  CFUmL coliform bacteriaas the threshold for SIBO [] In our case  CFUmLE coli existed in duodenal content and  CFUmL Ecoli existed in gastric content which met the traditionaldiagnostic criteria of SIBOrarelyOther diagnostic methods for SIBO are breath testsusing hydrogen or hydrogen methane with lactulose lucose [] Breath tests have clinical utility for diagnosing SIBO because they are less invasive than obtaining proximal small bowel content However there areno standardized criteria for diagnosing SIBO usingbreath tests [] We did not perform a breath test inour case studyDespite no previous reports of an association betweenunhealed pressure sores and SIBO nutritional status isknown to be important for the healing of pressure sores []In our case the sacral pressure sore which was initially refractory began to heal after starting treatment for SIBOAmong intrinsic factors related to the healing of pressuresores blood levels of hemoglobin albumin and zinc are especially important [] Our patient had anemia hypoalbuminemia and a low zinc

SIBO in our case as well as decreased physical activity due to fracture ofthe lefthumerus and bilateral tibiaChronic gastrointestinalinvolvement is seen in � of patients with SCI [  ] SCI patients lackcentral nervous system control over the gastrointestinalsystem [] Liu  report that bowel problems in SCIpatients are related to high levels of cord injury completeness of cord injury and postinjury durations of years or more [] Moderate or severe grade depressivestatus is also associated with neurologic bowel dysfunction in SCI patients Of these risk factors our patienthad complete cord injury that had occurred more than years ago Also many bowel symptoms appear in patients with SCI eg constipation distension incontinence abdominal pain bowel accidents nausea diarrheastrainingautonomichyperreflexia headaches or sweat relieved by a bowelmovement [  �] However our patient showedno appetite loss a sufficient amount of food intake andnonsevere bowel symptoms Thus the presence of malnutrition despite adequate food intake and low levels oflipidsoluble vitamins that were unresponsive to supplementation led us to suspect SIBOrectal bleeding hemorrhoidsAlthough gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SCI there are few reports ofSIBO in SCI patients Cheng  report that  of  of SCI patients were diagnosed with SIBO basedon the glucose hydrogenmethane breath test [] However the prevalence of SIBO among SCI patients as confirmed by the consensus diagnostic criteria ofthepresence of more than  CFUmL bacteria or anyamount of E coli in upper digestive tract content is unknown In patients with SCI absent central nervous system innervation of the digestive tract can change theinhabiting environment of bacteria Gungor  reportdifferences in gut microbial patterns between SCI patients and control individuals as measured by bacterialgenome sequencing [] Specifically they found thatbutyrateproducing bacteria were specifically reduced inSCI patients Thus it is possible that SIBO is overlookedin patients with SCI In our caseit is unclear whenSIBO occurred relative to the time of SCI but we suspect that it arose due to gastrointestinal motility disorder caused by autonomic disturbancesDisturbances in fat absorption and deficiency in fatsoluble vitamins ie vitamins A K E and D3 areobserved in patients with SIBO [] Excess bacteria inthe small intestine promotes a change from conjugatedbile acid into deconjugated bile acid which decreasesthe micellar solubilization of dietary fat Bacterial fermented short chain fatty acid causes osmotic watermovement to the intestinal lumen which results in diarrhea and malabsorption [] Intestinal epithelial damagein SIBO also interferes with fat absorption Mucosaldamage is caused by metabolites of aerobic bacteria endotoxins of anaerobic bacteria and lithocholic acidwhich is a bacterial degradation product of unconjugatedbile acid [�] Our patient however showed constipation rather than diarrhea in spite of SIBO Whether ornot diarrhea occurs in patients with SIBO is determinedby multiple factors Constipation frequently occurs inpatients with SCI due to decreased physical activity andautonomic dysfunction De Looze  reported that therate of constipation in the patients with SCI is  []A certain proportion of the patients with SCI show constipation in spite of the coexisting SIBO Cheng  reported that in patients with both SCI and SIBO showed constipation [] We believe that the factorsleading to constipation in our patient were stronger thanthose leading to diarrhea Vitamin D deficiency in SIBOcauses osteomalacia Our patientshowed multiplefractures and osteoporosis with serum vitamin D3 levelsbelow thetosupplementationrefractorydetectionlimitandThere is no consensus on the choice dose or durationof antibiotics for treating SIBO [] In principle antibiotics should be chosen based on the results of an antimicrobial susceptibility test but this approach cannotaddress the great diversity in microbiota of the digestivetract [ ] Metronidazole is a firstline choice forSIBO [] with other choices being rifaximin ciprofloxacin norfloxacin amoxicillinclavulanate trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole cephalexin or their combination []However these antibodies are selected based on customrather than scientific evidence [] In our case we usedoral polymyxin B and amphotericin B in accordancewith SDD which was first reported as a method of preventing ventilationassociated pneumonia and microbialtranslocation of gramnegative rod bacteria and fungi incritically ill patients treated in the intensive care unit[�] Polymyxin B administered to the digestive tractis nonabsorbent into the human body and has strongbactericidal power against gramnegative rod bacteriaexcept for naturally polymyxinresistant bacteria such asProteus Providencia Manella Burkholderia and Serratia [] Amphoteric B is an antifungal drug that isalso nonabsorbent into the human body when administered to the digestive tract In our case after startingSDD fatsoluble vitamins were increased and osteoporosis was improved No obvious adverse effects of SDD 0cKubota  BMC Gastroenterology            Page  of such as antibioticassociated diarrhea were observed inour caseWhen and how to stop antibiotherapy for the treatment of patients with SIBO are difficult problemsFew reports are available for the method and timingfor making a decision to stop antibiotherapy in SIBOLauritano  reported that the recurrence rate at months after stopping antibiotherapy in SIBO patientsis  [] They also showed that an older age history of appendectomy and chronic use of PPIs areassociated with SIBO recurrence Bures  reportedthat cyclical gastrointestinal selective antibiotics areneeded for SIBO treatment [] These reports indicatethat in many patients with SIBO it is actually impossible to stop antibiotherapy because of the underlyingconditions that lead to SIBO Similarly in our case itwas difficult to ameliorate the underlying condition ofdecreased motility of the digestive tract due to SCIWe were compelled to continue SDD for a long duration We did however succeed in gradually reducingthe dose of polymyxin B and end the use of amphotericin B without signs of SIBO recurrence Withcareful consideration it may be possible and feasibleto stop SDD completelyProbiotics are also a treatment approach for SIBO assome species of bacteria are thought to protect againsthigh numbers of E coli and fungi in the digestive tract[] However the role and effects of probiotics are stillunclear The digestive tract microbiome has both pathogenic potential and a protective role in maintaininghealth However metagenomic analysis reveals that � of microanisms in the digestive tract cannot becultured under laboratory conditions [] The effects ofSDD and probiotics on the digestive tract microbiome inpatients with SIBO should be investigated to furtherunderstand the pathogenesis of the diseaseIn conclusion we treated a patient with a sacral pressure sore who also had SCI multiple fractures withosteoporosis and malabsorption especially of fatsolublevitamins Based on culture of upper digestive tract content we diagnosed the patient with SIBO and startedSDD using polymyxin B and amphotericin B which effectively ameliorated the absorbency disturbance andallowed healing of the pressure sore In light of severalcommon risk factors between pressure sores and SIBOsuch as decreased physical activity our case providesadditional

assess the epidemiologyof chronic conditions and multimorbiditytheofIndeedattentionBackgroundMultimorbidity is commonly defined as the presence oftwo or more chronic medical conditions and its prevalence has been shown to increase with age [] As theworld�s older population continues to grow multimorbidity has become an important public health issue caphealthcareturingresearchersprofessionals as well as policy makersforhealthcare systems to effectively adapt and manage thedelivery of healthcare to our growing older populationan accurate description of the epidemiology of chronicconditions is required However to date studies in theliterature reveal wide disparities in prevalence estimatesof multimorbidity ranging from  to  [ ] Thislarge variability is thought to be due to the lack of standards defining multimorbidity and validated methods forhow it should be measured [] A recent systematic review reported  definitions of multimorbidity involving  differenttheappropriateness of different measures of multimorbidityis also variable depending on both the outcome of interest as well as the type of data that is available []In additioncriteria[]Measures of multimorbidity include diagnosisbasedmeasures eg Charlson Index based on hospital diagnosis codes ICD codes [] medicationbased measureseg RxRisk and RxRiskV for those aged �� yearsbased on pharmacy data [] and patient selfreportDiagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity are themost common measures and are generally based on hospital or physician records [] Medicationbased measures of multimorbidity include the RxRisk and RxRiskV � two algorithms which determine an individual�scurrent comorbidities based on their dispensed medication The RxRisk indexes only include morbidities forwhich a medicine could be prescribed and include categories of morbidities based on the World Health anisation WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Classification ATC system [�] The RxRisk and RxRiskVhave good reliability and criterion validity against ICD9diagnoses and have been shown to predict costs of caremortality and health care utilisation [] Previous studies have reported medicationbased measures of morbidity such as the Medicines Disease Burden Index MDBIand RxRiskV to be useful in epidemiological studieswhen adjusting for comorbidity [] However there arefew studies describing the use of these indices to directlymeasure chronic conditions Patient selfreport is also avalid method of identifying disease categories A study ofolder patients with multimorbidity reported good agreement between patient selfreport and general practitioner GP report for a wide range of diseases []A number of studies have compared the differentmeasures of multimorbidity with differing results [ ] A study of older primary care patients inIreland found that medicationbased measures ofmultimorbidity such as RxRiskV performed betterthan diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity inpredicting emergency and ambulatory care sensitiveACS admissions [] Studies comparing patientselfreport and diagnosisbased measures of multimorbidity have reported a stronger association between selfreport measures of multimorbidity andqualitythandiagnosisbased measures [ ] However no previous research has compared selfreported morbidityin the primary care or community setting with theRxRisk measures of morbidity Comparison betweenselfreported morbidity data and pharmacy records isimportant in order to understand the relative meritsof each measure of morbidity and the potential formisclassification particularly in the community setting where access to medical or clinical data can belimitedfunctionaloutcomesandlifeofStudies have also indicated that agreement betweenselfreport measures and other measures of morbiditymight be influenced by patient recall bias [] Patientrecall has been reported to be influenced by age maritalstatus and education [] There is also some evidencethat cognition and memory influence patient recall []The impact of these factors needs to be explored furtherwhen assessing and comparing measures of morbidityThe aim of this study was to  compare the agreementbetween patient selfreported morbidity and medicationbased morbidity RxRisk and RxRiskV and  examine potential patientlevel predictors of discordance between

oncological clinical trials that setthe standards of antineoplastic treatment [ ]Over the last three decades the fiveyear survival ratefor all types of cancer has increased particularly in individuals aged  to  [ ] Still older patients are atmore risk of toxicity in anticancer therapies such aschemotherapy and require a benefitrisk assessmentprior to treatment [] A comprehensive geriatric assessment CGA is consequently recommended in these patients to diagnose comorbidities and optimize geriatricinterventions and to improve the functional state andpossibly the survival rate by ensuring better tolerance totreatment [ ] CGA has also shown predictive valuein identifying elderly patients with cancer who are exposed to a poor prognosisincluding a higher risk ofdeath during

therapeutic decision is required to assess the balance of benefits and risks of performing or not performing specificoncologic interventions taking cancerspecific mortalityinto consideration Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate overall survival notably at  months with the Carey and Walter indexes [ ] These two scores consider dependency comorbidities with cancer and malnutrition Walter and collaborators reported independent associations betweenoneyear mortality in multivariable analysis and risk factors including male gender two medical diagnoses congestive heart failure aOR  95CI �

a prognosticindex for mortality in communityliving frail older individuals considering eight independent risk factors ofmortality weighted using Cox regression male sex dependence in toileting malignant neoplasm and renal insufficiency [] None of these tests were specificallydeveloped in cohorts with individuals with cancer andthey may consequently not be informative enough to reflect clinical and functional variability in daily care andto provide personalized corrective interventions Recentevidence reported a positive impact of geriatric interventions and monitoring in survival

accepted thatbetween  and  of people affected have no formaldementia diagnosis [] This growing epidemic effects notonly the individuals living with dementia but also theirfamilies caring for them the communities they live in andthe health care systems they rely uponFamily or friends are often key informal caregivers forpeople living with dementia [ ] Globally over billion hours ofinformal care is provided to peopleliving with dementia [ ] Whilst providing this carecan be highly rewarding it has also been described as achronic stressor with caregivers reporting low qualityand quantity of sleep [] and high levels of stress anddepression [] In fact sleep disruption is prevalentamongst dementia caregivers with over  of caregiversexperiencing sleep disturbances []The National Sleep Foundation recommend that olderadults �� years require seven to  h sleep for optimalphysical and psychological wellbeing [] Yet numerousstudies have illustrated that dementia caregivers sleepsignificantly less than that with estimates reporting mostcaregivers sleep less than  h per night [] Not only arecaregivers sleeping less than they should the sleep theydo get is of significantly lower quality than their noncaregiver counterparts []Poor sleep is associated with a myriad of negative physical and psychological outcomes including hypertensionobesity mood disorders and dementia [] A disruptedsleep pattern is also recognised as a significant factor inpredicting caregiver strain [ ] and perhaps more importantly in predicting placing an individual into long termcare [] Enabling people living with dementia to stay athome rather than transfer to longterm care is the optimaloutcome for many families However this cannot be to thedetriment of the caregiver�s own physical andor psychological wellbeing Therefore in order to support the personliving with dementia PLWD to remain in the communitymaintaining caregiver health is vital Given the pivotal rolesleep has in a myriad of physiological processes it is essential to optimise and preserve caregivers sleepDespite the important role sleep plays in dementiacaregiver health it remains an understudied populationparticularly within the

caregivers reporting lower stress levelsand improved health after use [] Sleep disturbanceshave also been shown to be partially reversed for caregiversduring periods of respite care [] perhaps due to reversalof hyper stressed state Respite services have been cited asan important measure to allow caregivers time to attend totheir own health imperative to supporting the caregiver tocontinue in providing care for their loved one []A recent Australian parliamentary inquiry into sleephealth identified sleep as a foundation of positive healthand wellbeing alongside diet and exercise [] Furthermore the report urged government to prioritise sleephealth as a national priority given its pivotal role inmaintaining health It is clear that caregivers of PLWDhave suboptimal sleep which is associated with poorerpsychological wellbeing and potential increased risk ofdeveloping chronic health conditions such as diabetesand cardiovascular disease [] Interestingly cardiovascular disease and endocrine disease such as diabeteswere the most prevalent comorbidities in our studypopulation Previous studies have also identified highblood pressure diabetes and arthritis as the most prevalent chronic disease in the dementia caregiver groupwhich is in keeping with our findings []Managing sleep and its associated mediators will havedirect impact on both the caregiver�s own health as wellas the caregiver care recipient relationship It is imperative to provide educational support around sleep considerpractical interventions such as overnight respite and toaddress stress management interventions for caregivers inturn reinstating and preserving sleep of this critical population of informal caregiversLimitationsA limitation of this study was the small sample size despitenumerous attempts to recruit participants and involvementof national anisations Although over  participantsprovided demographic details only  participants completed all questionnaires and were included in statisticalanalyses Challenges related to recruiting caregivers andparticularly caregivers of people living with dementia hasbeen described in numerous publications [   ]Caregivers of people with dementia living in the community are more likely to be female and this was representedin our population Furthermore caregivers who are underthe greatest stress may also be those least likely to participate However this remains one of the larger studies ofAustralian dementia caregivers sleep Another limitationwithin this study was that no data was collected regardingthe severity of dementia or behavioural disturbances whichmay impact sleep of the caregiverConclusionSleep problems are widespread within the population ofdementia caregivers Given that the majority of peopleliving with dementia are reliant on family caregiversminimising health and psychologicalimpact on caregivers should be of major concern Furthermore sleepquality is correlated with emotional distress in dementiacaregivers so improving the sleep of caregivers may inturn improve their psychological wellbeing Converselystress is a significant predictor of poor sleep so managing stress may have a positive impact on sleepDementia caregivers are often older with coexistingmorbidities and high levels of psychological distress Withprolonged caregiving and the progression of dementia ofthe care recipient there is the potential for a concurrent decline in the caregivers mental and physical health In orderto support the caregiver in their role it is of the upmost importance that we promote and maximises their health andwellbeing By managing and minimising the negative factorsassociated with caregiving we can enhance caregiving satisfaction and gratification In turn this can ensure optimalcaregivercare recipient relationship supporting the personliving with dementia to remain at home as long as possibleAbbreviationsDASS21 Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale21 PLWD

� with an especially higher rate in the elderly population [] Glioma accounts for approximately  of allcentral nervous system CNS tumors and  of malignant primary brain tumors [] According to the World Health anization WHO classification of tumors ofthe CNS gliomas were classified into fourgrades WHO grade I to IV based on histologic criteria[] WHO grades I and II gliomas are recognized as lowgrade gliomas LGG and grades III and IV are considered highgrade gliomas HGG [] In particular glioblastoma GBM WHO grade IV is the most commonmalignant tumor of the CNS accounting for  ofprimary malignant the CNS tumors and  of all gliomas [] The median survival of GBM patients is approximately  months even after receiving multimodaltherapies that include maximal surgical resection withthe preservation of neurological functions followed byadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy []Gliomas can occur at any age with various incidencesat different ages as reported in populationbased studies[  ] LGG is the most common brain tumor in children while HGG is the most frequent brain tumor inadults [] Tumors in the supratentorial areas of thebrain cerebral hemispheres and midline structuresabove the tentorium were most frequent in adults whilesubtentorial brainstem and cerebellum tumors weremore common in young children than in adolescentsand adults [] Besides increasing studies have assessedage a prognostic factor There are differences in prognosis among patients of different ages even with the samediagnosis A singlecenter review of  patients withintracranial anaplastic oligodendroglioma showed thatthe median survival time of patients younger than years old was significantly longer than that of patientsolder than  years old [] Other studies have shownthat age was an important prognostic factor in additionto KPS score surgical scope and histology [ ]Therefore for patients diagnosed with glioma by imaging examination and auxiliary examination it is necessary to consider the age of the patients to performpersonalized treatment for better outcomesHowever there is no uniform age criterion for groupingglioma patients for personalized treatment [] Some glioma patient cohorts were divided into different age groupsaccording to fixed age intervals [] some were dividedinto two groups based on a certain age point [] andothers were divided based on the overall survival OS ofthe patients [] Different criteria for age grouping haveled to inconsistent s regarding the prognosticvalue of age Some studies showed that age was not aprognostic factor in patients with glioma [ ] whileanother populationbased glioblastoma study with five agegroups   years � years � years � yearsand   years showed that the OS of young patients  years was significantly longer than that for elderly patients   years median  months vs  months p  [] Agerelated studies involving a large numberof glioma patients have yielded some relevant results [] but the age grouping criteria for these studies are influenced by several clinical factors such as the tendencyof clinical researchers Therefore there is an urgent needto establish a more appropriate age group classificationcriterion for better management of glioma patientsFor this purpose we conducted a retrospective studycollecting clinical data from  patients with histologically proven gliomas in Nanfang Hospital between and  Based on this cohort we established a methodof age group classification according to WHO grade forrisk stratification in glioma patients and investigated thecharacteristics of different age groups in

study was based on the Central BrainTumor Registry of the United States CBTRUS Brainand other Central Nervous System Tumor Site Groupings We recognize that with the  WHO classification of central

practiceTherefore these two groups were subdivided into fourgroups First dummy variables were created by agegroups of 0I years old and I47 years old I any age between  and  The established dummy variables wereconsidered as independent variables and a logistic regression model was set up according to whether gliomapatients were high grade glioma or WHO IV grade glioma The AIC value for each

category described by Paugh et al[]Although some of the molecular abnormalities encountered in HGG in children are reminiscent of secondaryglioblastomas these tumors rarely originate from existing

outcomes of malignant gliomas differsignificantly between adults and children [] A numberof studies have showed that the tumorprone locationshistopathology prognosis and some molecular markersare different in glioma patients of different ages [ ]Growing research has shown that the molecular characteristics of GBM in elderly patients are more aggressivethan those in young patients [] Childhood

prognosis of glioma is particularly severe in older adults [ ] The clinical practicepatterns show that with increasing age the applicationof surgical resection radiotherapy and chemotherapy decreases [�] Nevertheless some elderly patients withglioblastoma can benefitfrom these therapies []These elderly patients will receive aggressive treatmentwith radiation or chemotherapy When consideringtreatment options for children with gliomas neurosurgeons will try to avoid the deleterious effects of radiotherapy on the developing brains of children Minimaldysfunction resulting from glioma and treatment shouldbe achieved as much as possible with the expectation ofchildren living to adulthood [] Moreover age isregarded as an important factor related to the prognosisof glioma patients Thereforefor patients diagnosedwith glioma age should be taken into consideration toperform personalized treatment for a better outcomeHowever the criterion for appropriately dividing agegroups of glioma patients remains an unresolved clinicalproblemA large number of studies used different age groupings and these studies led us to differential sabout the prognosis value of age in glioma patients [ ] These contradictory s could be partlyexplained by the difference in age classification criteriabetween different studies In one study a multivariateCox regression model with different cutoff points wasused to analyze the effect of age on OS but only threeage groups were compared and univariate analysis wasperformed using prognostic factors as a classification criterion [] OS is a good indicator for evaluating patientoutcomes but confounding factors such as tumor sizetumor location surgical resection extent and patientcompliance might impair the accuracy of the relationship between age and OSTo avoid the disturbance of confounding factors asmuch as possible our study used the WHO grade of glioma as a dependent variable to assess the prognosis ofglioma patients The classification criteria for glioma patients based on age were � years old pediatric groupand � years old youth group � years oldmiddleaged group and ��  years old elderly groupThis age group classification can be used for preliminaryevaluation of newlydiagnosed glioma patients and helpsto perform precise management in clinical practice according to age group Besides we found that EGFRpositive expression was more common in the middleage group and the EGFR expression in IDH1mut gliomas was more apparent Therefore patients withIDH1mut glioma aged � years old might benefitfrom EGFR inhibitor therapy Based on this age groupclassification we further analyzed the characteristics ofWHO grade tumor size tumor histology and anatomical location among the four age groups We found thatthe proportion of WHO grade IV gliomas and positiveexpression of Ki67 Oligo2 and IDHwt increased significantly in elderly age groups In addition in the olderage group more patients suffered from a heavy tumorburden tumor size   cm Regarding the histology ofglioma pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common inchildren while glioblastoma accounts for the largest proportion of adult groups Many studies have demonstrated that patients with a higher grade of glioma havea worse outcome [] Moreover a larger tumor burdenmight cause a higher risk of functional deficits includingmotor dysfunction impaired communication ability ordecline in neurocognitive function [] Therefore theprognosis of patients with gliomas can initially be evaluated according to age On the other hand patientsgrouping according to age has been widely used in clinical studies but there is no uniform standard of agegroup classification for patients with glioma The agegroup established on the basis of objective pathologicaldiagnosis in this study will be helpful for clinical trialsdesign in the futureGlioma especially glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous malignancy In addition to the marked heterogeneity of tumor size and histopathology the heterogeneityof the molecular characteristics of tumors is becomingincreasingly important and is reported in several studiesAccording to the  WHO classification glioma isfirst classified according to histologicalfeatures andthen more subtypes are classified according to molecularcharacteristics There are a variety of indicators that arewidely used in clinical practice such as GFAP EMAMGMT P53 NeuN Oligo2 EGFR VEGF IDH1 Ki671p19q and these indicators are highly correlated withthe prognosis of the patients [�] Agedependentoccurrence and the effects of different biological markershave been reported in malignancies [] For examplethe association between age and tumor grade Ki67markers apoptosis index EGFR expression and erbB2expression has been reported in breast cancer [] Astudy indicated that the prognostic effects of P53 1pand CDKN2Ap16 alterations are dependent on patientage [] Increasing translational studies have significantly advanced the understanding of glioma pathogenesis and have identified several prognostic factorsHigher tumor grade older age [] and increased expression of molecular biomarkers such as P53 []MGMT [] PR []

in clinical practice or clinical studies on patients with glioma Our research can provide clinicians with a simple method toevaluate the prognosis of glioma patients and help topromote the

study was that we didnot include patients with postoperative recurrence Further validation of our results will require multicenterprospective studies with larger sample sizesConclusionOur research

women pregnant at a young agebut not in advanced yearsIn this population with a high prevalence of vitamin Ddeficiency better serum vitamin D status contributed toa lower risk of GDM This result was consistent withseveral other studies A  to  higher risk of GDMwas observed for pregnant women with insufficient ordeficient vitamin D status in three systematic reviewsand metaanalyses based on observational studies orclinical trials [  ] In a large randomized controltrial RCT based on  Iranian women the intervention of 25OHD3 was associated with lower risk ofGDM [] The results were further

the risk of low birthweight or preterm birth in a metaanalysis based on randomized trials [] these results were further supported byanother update study [] In addition higher 25OHDconcentrations were

the previous evidence inthis field and there may be several factors that partly explain these differences First most of the randomized trials included had a small sample size and were of lowquality

detrimental influence of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency in the reference group [] Increasing benefitsmight not exist for higher doses Second the vitamin Dreceptor is important for the utilization of vitamin D[ ] The difference in vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism might help explain the ethnic heterogeneity[] This requires further confirmation in the futureThird the studies were conducted during different trimesters of gestation which might increase the difficultyof making comparisons those studies conducted duringan early gestational period might be advantageous forcausal inference and early preventionBecause 25OHD3 contributes most to the 25OHDconcentrations it has been used to represent 25OHDin many studies and only a few studies have focused on25OHD2 In our study the results were generally consistent between these two subcomponents The associations tend to be more pronounced in 25OHD2 than in25OHD3 and mightindicate the prominence of25OHD2 over 25OHD3 for the prevention of relateddiseases This theory merits further confirmation Nevertheless our results and others provide further evidencefor the importance of a better early vitamin D status forthe prevention of GDM cesarean section preterm birthand low birth weight in a population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency Our results indicated thatmore consideration should be given to distinguishing between the vitamin D subcomponents women pregnantat different ages and women with more pregnancy complications in this field Considering the high prevalenceof vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy observed inChina [ ] it is a matter of urgency to call for the supplementation of vitamin D and more efforts should bemade to improve the gestational vitamin D status ofChinese populationVitamin D deficiency was found to decrease vasculardiameter within the labyrinth region and dysregulateplacental development during early pregnancy in an animal experiment [] Vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy might rescue this situation while furthersupplementation might be futile after missing this timepoint [] Moreover vitamin D supplementation duringearly pregnancy is likely to affect genetic information ofsystemic inflammation and immune responses involvedin the development of gestational comorbidities egGDM preeclampsia and infection as reviewed by Hollis [] These mechanisms help to explain the beneficialinfluences of vitamin D for maternal and infanthealth and emphasize the importance of improving vitamin D status during early pregnancyOurstudy had several advantages Firstserum25OHD concentrations were measured during an earlygestational period and with the retrospective cohort design we assured the temporal sequence and avoided thepossibility of causal inversion Second we studied multiple outcomes and conducted further analysis of thesubcomponent of vitamin D and a stratified analysis ofgestational age which provided a more comprehensiveunderstanding of this field There are also several limitations of our study First our study was limited by thelack of information on dietary vitamin D intake including by supplement and sunlight exposure during thepregnancy period The obtained data were difficult touse for a retrospective study while the use of blood indicators might be more precise than a dietary survey sowe adjusted the association for different seasons to attenuate their influence Second the 25OHD concentration was measured only once we could not monitor thedynamic changes afterward or determine whether theywere normalized after receiving vitamin D supplementation However the associations tended to be underestimated instead of overestimated Third Wagner et al[] and Mirzakhani  [] indicated a 25OHDconcentration ��  nmolL in early pregnancy was optimal for the prevention of preterm birth and preeclampsia however the highest 25OHD concentration in ourstudy is only  nmolL Therefore we were unable toperform the analyses using a threshold of  nmolLand assess the influences of higher 25OHD concentrations Finally residual confounding might still existthough we tried to control several potential covariatesConclusionsThis retrospective cohort study showed the beneficial associations of early gestational vitamin D with outcomesof GDM cesarean section preterm birth and low birthweight

prostate cancer manifests as a dominatingcause of malerelated death worldwide and is characterized as the most continually occurred tumor amongmen in the United States [] The biggest challenge isthe detectable bone metastases in roughly  advancedprostate cancer [] Virtually all prostate cancer patientsduring  years� androgen deprivation treatment inevitably undergo castrationresistance which contributes tothe poor clinical consequences in prostate cancer []However the mechanism underlaid prostate cancer remains mostly unknownThe widely studied long noncoding RNAs lncRNAsare transcribed from nonproteincoding human genomeand have more than  nt in length [] LncRNAs are increasingly functionally identified and experimentally consolidated to be related to tumor neoplasia and progressionin diverse cancers [] Additionally lncRNAs with dysregulation can functionally modulate tumor developmentfrom multiple pathological aspects such as cell proliferation drugresistance and metastasis [�] For examplelncRNA A1BGAS1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasionin hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting miR216a5p []LncRNA LOC730100 sponges miR760 from FOXA1 toaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion in glioma []LncRNA SNHG16 functions as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma [] Long intergenic nonprotein codingRNA  LINC00992 is a novel lncRNA that has beenpreviously revealed to be elevated in tumors and substantiated as a master regulator for chemoresistance [] Besides LINC00992 has been uncovered as an elevatedlncRNA in prostate cancer [] which is consistent withthe detection from GEPIA database Despite that no previous study has given a comprehensive explanation aboutthe precise function or detailed mechanism of LINC00992in prostate cancerIn past decades the fact that lncRNAs function in tumors depending on their secondary or tertiary structureshas been reported in many cancerlinked studies For instance in the nucleus lncRNAs are entitled to work asmolecular scaffolds or alternative splicing assistants [] On the contrary lncRNAs dispersing in cytoplasm influence downstream mRNA translation or degradationthrough serving as miRNA sponges [ ] For exampleTNFαinduced lncRNA LOC105374902 promotes themalignant behaviors of cervical cancer cells by acting as asponge of miR12853p [] LncRNA TTNAS1 promotes papillary thyroid cancer tumorigenesis by regulatingmiR1533pZNRF2 axis[] Nevertheless whetherLINC00992 could exert its functions in prostate cancer viaits sponging role of certain miRNA remains unknownWe conducted this research aiming to explore thefunction or probable mechanism of LINC00992 in prostate tumor which might enrich the understanding interms of prostate tumor pathology and contribute to awider applied scopeMethodsTissue

effect ofLINC00992 deficiency on prostate cancer cell proliferation Additionally the expression levels of proliferationrelated proteins PCNA CDK2 and Cyclin D1 were allreduced by silenced LINC00992 Figure S1C On thecontrary TUNEL assay uncovered that LINC00992knockdown facilitated cell apoptosis Fig 1f Meanwhile western blot analysis revealed that LINC00992knockdown promoted the apoptosis of

cells Fig 2bc highlighting a posttranscriptional control of LINC00992 in such cellsHence we speculated that LINC00992 might act as aceRNA in prostate cancer regulation According toDIANAlncBase the top three potential miRNAs possessing the binding capacity with LINC00992 were listedFig 2d To targetthe highlymatched miRNA toLINC00992 qRTPCR analysis was conducted to testthe expression changes of these miRNAs following eitherLINC00992 depletion or augmentation The resultsdemonstrated that only miR3935 expression was increased by LINC00992 depletion Fig 2e but reducedby LINC00992 overexpression in the meantime Fig 2fThus miR3935 was chosen for further analysis Afterwards RNA pull down assay was implemented and theresult depicted that LINC00992 was pulled down byBiomiR3935WT Fig 2g which indicated the bindingof LINC00992 and miR3935 Later we observed thesatisfactory efficiency of miR3935 overexpression andmiR3935 inhibition through qRTPCR analysis Fig2h Thereafter RIP assay applying

bindwith downstream target genes to inhibit their expressionHerein we searched the miR3935 target genes andeight mRNAs were found out Subsequently we detectedtheir expression in prostate cancer cells and normalcells Interestingly we found that only Golgi membraneprotein  GOLM1 was highly expressed in four prostate cancer cell lines relative to normal controls Fig 3aFurther we discovered that GOLM1 expression wasmarkedly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues according to data from GEPIA database Fig 3b SimilarlyGOLM1 expression was much higher in prostate cancertissue samples than in peritumor samples Figure S3AIn addition the mRNA and protein levels of GOLM1were overexpressed in prostate cancer cells in contrastto RWPE1 cells Fig 3c Figure S3B Besides GOLM1has been previously revealed as a prostate cancer facilitator and was metastasisrelated in prostate tumor [�] Thus we hypothesized that GOLM1 might act asthe downstream of LINC00992miR3935 signaling inprostate cancer Through TargetScan httpwwwtargetscanvert_72 the binding site between GOLM1and miR3935 was predicted Fig 3d After conductingluciferase reporter assay in DU145 and PC3 cells weobserved that upregulation of miR3935 specifically decreased the luciferase activity of GOLM1WT reporterFig 3e confirming the interaction between miR3935and GOLM1 relied on the putative binding sites Thenwe unveiled that GOLM1 mRNA and protein levels wereboth reduced by LINC00992 inhibition or miR3935upregulation according to qRTPCR and western blotanalyses Fig 3fg Figure S3C Moreover data fromRIP assay unveiled the binding

dysregulated circRNAs serve asprognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in osteosarcomapatients and the relative potential mechanism mainly attributes to the regulation of downstream signaling pathwaysby sponging microRNA In addition lncRNA [] microRNA [] and many clinical data [] were also identified asprognostic biomarkers for osteosarcoma patients However osteosarcoma is one of the malignant cancers entitiescharacterized by the high level of heterogeneity in humansTherefore it is necessary to find accurate biomarkers forosteosarcomaIn recent years researchers have paid more and moreattention to the role of the tumor microenvironmentTME in malignant tumors The function of TME inthe tumorigenesis progression and therapy of tumorshave been initially understood [ ] More

prognostic biomarkers for osteosarcoma patients and two nomograms were developed for predicting the OS and DFS of osteosarcoma patientsrespectivelyIn recent years an increasing number of studiesfocused on the carcinogenesis and progression of tumorsbased on the TME and the ESTIMATE algorithm is oneof the most important quantitative tools for this researchfield Based on the ESTIMATE algorithm the association between the prognosis and TME has been initially 0cHu  BMC Cancer            Page  of elucidated in some tumors such as cervical squamouscell carcinoma gastric cancer cutaneous melanomaacute myeloid leukemia bladder cancer and clear cellrenal carcinoma [   �] However previousstudies indicated that TME scores serve as a differentrole in different tumors For example for hepatocellularcarcinoma gastric cancer acute myeloid leukemiabladder cancer and clear cell renal carcinoma patientswith high immune score have a worse prognosis [  �] However for cervical squamous cell carcinoma adrenocortical carcinoma and cutaneous melanoma patients with high immune score have a favorableprognosis [  ] Therefore we can find great heterogeneity among different tumors from the perspectiveof TME For osteosarcoma patients the present studyindicated that patients with higher immune score had abetter OS and DFS Hence the present study indicatedthat immune cells infiltrating tumor tissue may play animportant role in suppressing tumor progressionIn our research  TMErelated genes were identified by comparing the highscore and lowscore osteosarcoma patients The functional enrichment includingGO and KEGG analyses showed that TMErelated geneswere mainly involved in the immune features such asregulation of leukocyte activation MHC protein complex MHC protein and complex binding More importantly the unsupervised cluster analysis based on DEGswas performed and all patients were divided into twoclusters Immune score and T cell CD4 memory activated fraction were significant difference between twoclusters which further elucidated the relationship between DEGs and immune featuresDue to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patientsidentifying robust prognostic biomarker is very importantThe tumor immune microenvironment is closely relatedto the prognosis of bone tumor patients Emilie etal []performed the first genomewide study to describe therole of immune cells in osteosarcoma and found thattumorassociated macrophages are associated with reduced metastasis and improved survivalin highgradeosteosarcoma Recently the prognostic signature based onTMErelated genes have been established for many tumors [  ] but only one study focused on osteosarcoma patients [] Compared with the study performedby Zhang  [] we think that our research have someadvantages Firstly our signatures were established basedon several validated genes and both two signatures weresuccessfully validated in independent cohorts Secondlythe outcome of DFS was not reported in the previousstudy As reported in published studies tumor recurrenceis a terrible medical problem for osteosarcoma patientsand the 5year survival rate for osteosarcoma patients withmetastasis or relapse remains disappointing [ ]Hence the DFS nomogram can improve the managementof osteosarcoma patients Finally two nomograms incorporated TMErelated signature and clinical variables wereestablished in our research which further facilitated theclinical application of our findingsIn our research five genes were incorporated into thefinal prognostic signatures FCGR2B GFAP and MPP7were identified and validated as OSrelated biomarkerswhile CYP2S1 and ICAM3 were DFSrelated biomarkersThe role of these genes in tumor prognosis had beenwidely reported in previous studies [�] FCGR2Bhas been confirmed as an immunerelated gene previously [] Although the relationship between FCGR2Band prognosis in sarcoma patients had not been reported the prognostic value of FCGR2B had been widelyconfirmed in other cancerssuch as hepatocellularcarcinoma and glioblastoma [ ] In addition NewM etal [] demonstrated that MPP7 is novel regulatorsof autophagy which was thought to be responsible forthe prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaCYP2S1 described as Cytochrome P450 Family  Subfamily S Member  was reported significantly associatedwith colorectal cancer In primary colorectal cancerCYP2S1 was present at a significantly higher level ofintensity compared with normal colon [] More importantly the presence of strong CYP2S1 immunoreactivity was associated with poor prognosis [] The roleof ICAM3 in cancer was also widely reported in published studies and the Akt pathway plays an importantrole in the impact of ICAM3 on tumors YG Kim etal[] reported that ICAM3 can induce the proliferationof cancer cells through the PI3KAkt pathway Additionally JK Park etal showed that the ICAM3 can enhancethe migratory and invasive potential of human nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducing MMP2 andMMP9 via Akt pathway [] showed that the ICAM3can enhance the migratory and invasive potential ofhuman nonsmall celllung cancer cells by inducingMMP2 and MMP9 via Akt pathwayAlthough the role of TME and TMErelated genes inosteosarcoma patients have been initially studied by bioinformatic and statistical analyses in our research somelimitations should be elucidated Firstly the treatmentinformation cannot be obtained from the TARGET database which may influence the prognosis of osteosarcomapatients Secondly two nomograms were generated andshowed good performance in our study However externalvalidation by a large cohort is needed Thirdly many independent prognostic genes for osteosarcoma patients wereidentified in the present study but the potential mechanism to influence osteosarcoma remains unclear Finally inthe training cohort  and  DEGs were identified asOS and DFSrelated DEGs respectively However onlyfive OS and five DFSrelated genes were identified in

BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC is one of themost lethal forms of cancer and expected to become thesecond leading cause of cancerrelated deaths before Developments in pancreatic cancer diagnosticssurgical techniques and treatment have hardly improvedthe survival rate in the past  years The 5year relativesurvival rate as reported by the American Cancer Societyremains only  [ ]Only � of all patients are eligible for surgery todate the only potential cure [] Approximately � ofall patients with pancreatic cancer have metastatic diseaseat diagnosis and  of all patients have locally advanceddisease with tumor involvement of surrounding vessels orans At the time of surgery approximately � ofthe patients are considered unresectable because of unexpected liver metastasis peritoneal carcinomatosis or locally advanced disease [�]More than  of all liver metastases develop in thefirst six months postoperatively [] These liver metastases are most likely already present at the time of diagnosis and have not been identified preoperatively as theyare too small to be detected by routine preoperativeultrasound and contrastenhanced CT CECT [ ]CECT is highly accurate in assessing the relationship ofthe tumor to critical arterial and venous structures sincetheir involvement can preclude surgical resection HoweverCECT has a poor sensitivity � for the detection andcharacterization of liver metastases [ �] especiallyfor subcentimeter metastases which are often present inpancreatic cancer [] This leads to futile surgical treatment with all the associated morbidity mortality and costsMoreover patients who were explored with curative intentand were found unresectable due to peritoneal or liver metastases had a worse overall survival compared to patientswith unexpected locally advanced disease []Nowadays diffusionweighted MR imaging DWI appears to be valuable in both detection and characterizationof focal liver lesions with a high sensitivity � evenfor subcentimeter lesions � [�] This technique can be used to detect and characterize liver lesionsbased on decreased diffusion of water molecules caused bytumoral hypercellularity and reduced extracellular spaceDWI is especially useful for detecting subcentimeter livermetastasesit is more accurate than conventional T2weighted imaging techniques because signal suppression ofintravascular flow is obtained black blood effect whilemaintaining good residual signal of the liver lesions [] Itis easy to implement and adds very little time to a standardMRI examination However without highquality evidenceof the benefit of MRI the use of MRI as part of the routineworkup is questioned and therefore not implemented Currently most guidelines advise to use MRI as a problemsolving tool in addition to CECT eg when the primarytumor cannot be visualized or in case of undefined liver lesions [�] The American Society of Clinical OncologyASCO leaves the choice of imaging modality in the handsof the physician [] MRI is advised for all patients according to the Japanese guideline however the level of evidenceis low grade C []Most studies that have been performed for liver metasincluding our singletases of PDAC are

Inclusion of patients is expected tobe finished December accuracy ofDiscussionThe purpose of the DIAPANC trial is to investigate thediagnosticcontrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI in patients with suspected PDAC for thedetection of liver metastases Additionally we will evaluatewhether performing contrastenhanced diffusionweightedMRI will improve the detection of liver metastases compared to CECT by determining the sensitivity and specificity of CECT for the detection of liver metastasesDespite the good diagnostic performance of MRI forliver metastases the benefits of MRI remain unclearmostly because of low level of evidence heterogeneityand bias in the performed studies Two recently published metaanalyses have suggested the results shouldbe confirmed by performing a welldesigned and sufficiently powered study directly comparing liver CT andMRI in the same cohort [ ]A major difficulty in the interpretation of the currentliterature is that most studies are retrospective oftenonly reporting on a subset of patients actually undergoing a resection patients with borderline resectable tumors or patients with indeterminate liver lesions onCECT These patients have a higher probability of 0cLitjens  BMC Cancer            Page  of having liver metastases However in an era of neoadjuvant therapy local ablative therapy for advanced tumorsexpensive targeted therapies and resection of oligometastases MRI may be beneficial to patients with allstages of PDAC Therefore all patients with suspectedPDAC are eligible for inclusion in the DIAPANCMRI field strength  T versus  T was a significant factor in the heterogeneity between studies that was found ina metaanalysis  T MRI had a higher sensitivity  anda lower specificity  for diagnosing liver metastasiscompared to  T MRI sensitivity  and specificity[] Because the signaltonoise ratio and thelesiontoliver contrast are higher on  T MRI than on T MRI it is reasonable that a  T MRI permits a higher lesion detection rate [ ] In the DIAPANC study weplan to perform all MRIs on a  T scanner A potentialdownside of a multicenter design is the intervendor variability that could occur when comparing the quantitativeApparent Diffusion Coefficient ADC value this variabilityseems to be more pronounced at  T than at  T []Availability of MRI is not expected to be an issue asMRI is available in every expert center for pancreaticdiseases However problems with MRI capacity couldarise due to the need for MRI within a short intervalafter CT A time interval of two weeks was chosen toprovide a feasible time frame for MRI to be performedand no intervallesions are expected within this timeinterval []The DIAPANC trial is the first international prospective multicenter cohort study about the diagnostic accuracyof contrastenhanced diffusionweighted MRI On theWorld Health anization trial registry website ICTRPincorporating all inter national trial registries there areonly four other prospective trials registered in this fieldThe first trialis a completed French prospectivemulticenter trial presumably the only one prospective study that has been published [] The studyhas been performed in  patients with potentiallyresectable pancreatic cancer on a  T scanner usinggadobenate dimeglumine MultiHance as contrastagent The study has been performed to assess thediagnostic performance of diffusionweighted MRIfor the preoperative diagnosis of liver metastasis andthe modification of therapeutic strategy as a consequence ofliver metastasis ondiffusionweighted MRI []the diagnosis ofThe second trial is a British single center observational study with a target sample size of  patientswith confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer referred for pancreaticoduodenectomy and is completed recently The primary outcome of this studyis the proportion of patients correctly identified byMRI to have lymph node peritoneal or liver metastases To our knowledge the results have not beenpublished and there is no information on scan parameters and contrast agent available []The third trial from Australia is the only randomizedcontrolled trial The study has a target sample size of patients and is not yet recruiting The aim of the studyis to compare the 12month recurrence rate in patientswith locally operable pancreatic adenocarcinoma managed with standard preoperative assessment of liver metastases with CECT versus preoperative assessment withliver specific contrast MRI []The fourth trial is a Chinese comparative study and isnot yet recruiting The study aims to compare liver specific contrast MRI and CECT in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer with a target sample size of  patients []The DIAPANC trial hypothesizes a superior value ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT To reliably determine the diagnostic accuracy thegold standard is histopathology of the liver lesions Considering it is not always possible and sometimes even unethical to obtain histopathological proof of every lesionfollowup is used as a reference standard Hence we areable to simultaneously gather information on early localrecurrence or metastases after resection disease progression and therapy response evaluation on MRI and CECTIn conclusion the DIAPANC trial is expected to report highlevel evidence of the diagnostic accuracy ofMRI for the detection of liver metastases compared toCECT resulting in significant value for clinical decisionmaking guideline development and improved stratification for treatment strategies and future trials Furthermore

extracts to treat patients with metastatic advanced breastcancer The condition was significantly alleviated sparkinginterest in exploring the relationship between thyroid andbreast cancer [] Subsequently a prospective study enrolled  women and  women with earlier diagnosisof hypothyroidism observed the occurrence of breast cancer during followup showed that low serum free thyroxine levels increased the risk of breast cancer [] In  aprospective women withhypothyroidism and  hyperthyroidism found thathypothyroidism slightly reduced the risk of breast cancer[] However a prospective cohort study of women with autoimmune hypothyroidism and women with normal thyroid function indicated that autoimmune hypothyroidism was not associated with breastcancer risk [] Besides some animal experiments alsoreflect the relationship between the two [ ] Animalexperiments by López Fontanafound thathypothyroidism mice inhibit the development of breastcancer and promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cellsdue to the low expression of βchain protein and activation of the apoptotic pathway on the tumour cell membrane [] Due to the inconsistency ofthe aboveconclusions we performed a metaanalysis to evaluate therelationship between hypothyroidism and breast cancerrisketalA total of  studies were included in this metaanalysis and the results showed that patients withhypothyroidism not related to the risk of breast cancerHowever there was significant heterogeneity among theincluded studies After subgroup analysis and sensitivityanalysis we found that Cristofanilli�s research may causeheterogeneity [] Cristofanilli�s research is a retrospective study and the diagnosis of hypothyroidism patientswas based on the information recorded in the medicalrecords which may lead to the bias risk of misclassification and have a positive impact on the positive results ofthis study [] After excluding Cristofanilli�s researchwe found that patients with hypothyroidism had a lowerrisk of breast cancer with borderline significance [] Theresults of the metaanalysis are inconsistent with the findings of Hardefeldt  and Angelousi  [ ] Perhaps because our study included more prospective studiesand Asian population cohort study In addition we evaluated the risk of breast cancer in thyroid hormone replacement therapy and show that patients who received thyroidhormone replacement therapy was not related to the riskof breast cancerIn the analysis of the European population the resultsshow that hypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breastcancer We also found that patients with hypothyroidismcan reduce the risk of breast cancer was borderline significance in the subgroup with more longer followupdate However the relationship between the two was notobserved in North American and Asian populationsThe possible reasons for these disparities may be as follows First followup time may be the main contributorsto this difference A longer followup is required to demonstrate the relationship between hypothyroidism andbreast cancer risk In the metaanalysis five studies provided North American population data and two reported Asian population data However only one ofseven nonEuropean studies� followup time for morethan  years Second the differences may be attributedto different ethnicities sharing different genegene andgeneenvironmental backgrounds Third social and environmental factors are another critical cause for thisdifference With these in mind our findings suggest thathypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breast canceronly in the European population and more largescalehighqualitylongterm prospective cohort studies arestill needed to study on different human populationsThe following may explain the potential relationshipbetween hypothyroidism and the risk of breast cancerHealthy mammary epithelial cells can express a largenumber of T3 receptors and breast cancer cells have asimilar ability to bind to T3 [] T3 has an estrogenlike effect that promotes the growth of mammary glandlobes and stimulates normal breast tissue differentiation[ ] Therefore T3 can mimic the effect of estrogenon the proliferation of breast cancer cells When theconcentration of T3 is low in vivo it may inhibit theproliferation of breast cancer cells Hypothyroidism mayreduce the risk of breast cancer by affecting T3concentrationSome basic experiments support this theory In GonzalezSancho  studied the relationship betweenT3 and breast cancer [] It was found that there is anoverexpressed T1 gene in human breast cancer cellsand T3 inhibits the proliferation of mammary epithelialcells by inhibiting the expression of cyclin D1 and T1thereby inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells 0cWang  BMC Cancer            Page  of Author

mannerthathypothyroidism through lower levels of T3 could reducethe incidence of breast cancer Our metaanalysis resultsalso confirm the above conjecture[] Therefore we suspectHowever this conclusion needs to be taken with caution as this study has several limitations First the studies that have been included do not adjust for importantrisk factors for breast cancer Second in subgroup analysis for example there are only two s in Asianstudies and we should be cautious about the results ofAsian analysis Third the results of this metaanalysis indicate that there is a large heterogeneity between studiesFourth followup time at different endpoints cannot beuniform Finally publication bias cannot be avoidedentirelyConclusionHypothyroidism may reduce the risk of breast cancer inthe European

different screening andearly detection methods as well as different biologicalbehaviors disease characteristics and ethnicity [�]treatment mainlySurgical resection is the only radical therapy for gastricgastroesophageal junction GGEJ cancer Howeversystemic chemotherapy is an alternative main therapyfor GGEJ cancer because of the high relapse rate afterpostresection surgery and for the many

patient survival times is urgently neededinparticular for firstline treatmentinhibitor treatmentImmune checkpointis a newapproach for tumor immunotherapy [ ] The treatment diminishes the immune system tolerance to tumorcells and improves the effective identification and eradication of tumor cells by blocking T cell inhibition [] Theprogrammed death1 PD1 antibody specifically binds toPD1 thereby inhibiting apoptosis of antigenspecific Tcells and thus reducing regulatory T cell Treg apoptosisby inhibiting the activation of PDL1 [ ]patients with recurrent or advanced GC In the ATTRACTION2 study nivolumab monotherapy improvedOS from  to  months hazard ratio   CI� P   compared with a placebo in advanced GC that was refractory or intolerant to previoustreatment regimens []However between  and  of patients exhibit noresponse to PD1 blockade which is considered to beassociated with T cell exclusion or exhaustion or inadequate T cell trafficking and many immunosuppressivefactors accumulate in the tumor microenvironment []New therapy regimens that improve the response andlongterm efficacy are desperately needed The efficacy ofantiPD1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy hasbeen confirmed in nonsmallcell lung cancer [ ] Inaddition to direct tumor killing conventional cytotoxicchemotherapy has demonstrated immunoregulatory properties by enhancing tumor antigenicity disturbing immunesuppressive pathways inducing immunogenic cell deathand increasing effector Tcell reactions [] It is safe tohypothesize that antiPD1 antibodies in combination withchemotherapy may further improve the clinical outcomesof patients with advanced GC Sintilimab is a highly selective monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interactionsbetween PD1 and its ligands with strong antitumorresponse [] A phase 1a study for dose escalation hasdemonstrated the tolerance and pharmacological activity ofsintilimab in patients with advancedstage solid tumors butthere is limited evidence for the efficacy of antibodiesagainst PD1 plus chemotherapy in Chinese GGEJ adenocarcinoma patients Thus the present trial was conductedto investigate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab combinedwith CapeOx

as a reliable technique to identifymutated driver genes and for the estimation of TMBsIts use has led to the detection of actionable alterationsin various cancer related genes [] Regarding highTMB and the efficacy of PD1 treatments inconsistentresults have been reported in previous studies Wang  suggested that TMB might be associatedwith better efficacy for PD1 monotherapy [] whereasMishima  [] did not find a significant relationshipbetween TMB and the response of gastric cancers toPD1 therapy [] The latter data is in accordance withour finding that after treatment with sintilimab in combination with CapeOx no significant difference in theclinical responses was found between HTMB and LTMB patients However using the median TMB as acutoff is difficult to extrapolate to the real world clinicand bias due to the small sample size could not beexcluded in the present study In addition it has beennoted that up to now there is no uniform standard forHTMB [] and further investigations are urgentlyrequiredConclusionsOur results strongly indicate that sintilimab combined withCapeOx is an option for the firstline treatment of patientswith advanced or metastatic GGEJ adenocarcinoma However the sample size was small and it was a singlearmstudy without a comparator The large scale doubleblinded and randomized Phase III clinical trial ORIENT16for previously untreated advanced GGEJ

tumorigenesis and foundin human trophoblast and chorionic cell lines Studieshave shown that overexpression of TROP2 is associatedwith tumorigenesis and malignancy [�]In thisstudy TROP2 expression was observed to be a highlysensitive and specific marker of tongue squamous cellcarcinoma and tissue stiffness The relative thickness ofsamples helped accurately diagnose and determine thestaging of tongue squamous cell carcinomaImmunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression of TROP2 in poorly differentiated OSCC tissueswas significantly higher than that in welldifferentiatedOSCC tissues Additionally TROP2 upregulation wascorrelated with tumors of advanced TNM III  IV staging and poor differentiation than that in tumors withlow TNM I  II staging Thus the abnormal expressionof TROP2 may be associated with the occurrence anddevelopment of tongue malignancies Furthermore highTROP2 expression predicted low survival as comparedto that in the tumors with low TROP2 expression Previous research has also demonstrated the correlation between shorter patient lifespan and high levels of TROP2as compared to that in patients with laryngeal squamouscell carcinoma and low levels of TROP2 [] TROP2possesses sites for tyrosineserine phosphorylation thatregulate signal transduction or its expression and activity thereby rendering cancer cells resistant to apoptosis[] Upregulated TROP2 correlates with the poor prognosis of thyroid papillary carcinoma [] colon cancer[] liver cancer [] and other malignanciesThere have been an increasing number of studies on thebiological role of TROP2 at the molecular level TROP2induces the downregulationloss of PTEN thereby stimulating PI3KAKT signaling and tumor development []PTEN is a wellknown tumor suppressor that is a phosphatase [] and affects the PI3KPKBAKT signaling axisduring the dephosphorylation of PIP2 and PIP3 []PI3K signaling is important in regulating tumor cell proliferation migration and invasion [ ] Thus PTEN is anegative regulator of cancer [ ] Li  have shownthat TROP2 activates epithelialmesenchymal transitionvia PI3KAKT signaling thereby promoting proliferationmigration and metastasis in gallbladder cancer [] Similarly TROP2 expression stimulates the proliferation migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells [] Hou et aldemonstrated that TROP2 regulates JAK2STAT3 signaling in glioblastoma cells []

on biomedical and physical parametersIn this study we have assayed the changes in mechanicalproperties at the micronanometer level using AFM anddetermined the association between the TNM

percutaneousnerve filtration and vascular invasion Moreover high levelsof TROP2 correlated with poor overall survival in patientsHighly differentiated cancer tissues exhibited increasedsurface roughness and stiffness Lastly high TROP2 expression resulted in reduced tumor stiffness However thisstudy had some limitations First the cohort used in thisstudy was relatively small Second we did not employ molecular methods of analysis such as western blotting orenzymelinked immunosorbent assay Thus using a largerpatient cohort and multiple techniques in molecular andcell biology will help validate our findings and developTROP2 as a specific and efficient prognostic biomarker forOSCCConclusionThese findings could promote new methods for the earlyOSCC diagnosis depend on the stage of
