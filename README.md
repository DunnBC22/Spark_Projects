# Spark Projects

### Notes About This Repository
I noticed that some of the HTML file versions of projects were 'too large to load', so I included the Python Notebook (ipynb) versions as well.

I have many more projects that I will add soon. If there is a topic that you are interesting in seeing if I have completed any work with, feel free to reach out to me and ask.

### UPDATES
For all of the NLP and Computer Vision projects, I made sure to not overtrain projects. Each time I ran a project multiple times with different arguments. I kept notes of the metrics for each run. At the end, I made sure to pick the version of the project right around where the metrics evened off (this usually happened with the epochs argument). For example, if the metrics started to even off at 11 epochs, I would pick either 11 or 12.

I just thought about how a way to make sure to not overtrain projects relating to tabular/structured data. Unfortunately, even though this is a concern that I have had since before I started working with Databricks, I did not think of it until after completing near 30 different projects. I am noting this as I am aware of it and will make the changes going forward.
